   the shutter lag is on par with what i  ve experienced with point and shoot   mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed   x    mb compact flash

would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range      since i wrote the review above in january        i still love this camera    i  ve picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful    i bought a digi slave dsf  s flash unit    i do n t use a bracket   i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand    i also got a ur e   step down ring adapter   lc e     lens cap   and the nikon   mm filter set    this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters    i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time    this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap    the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on   the camera wo n t fit in the small cases   and   mm filters are expensive and hard to find  "]
,"negative": ["      pictures wo n t transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable    i did everything i could   and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader    card reader is included        the speed is noticeably slower than canon   especially so with flashes on        with low battery   it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip    i used lexar     mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar    be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries  ","    this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can  t be stopped    would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing      if you want to have the date   time on the image   its only through their software   nikon view   which reads the images date   time from the images meta data    so if you use your card reader   copy images   you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date   time    in that too   there is n t a direct way to add date   time   you got to say   print images   to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date   time  image","    even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your imageindoor image","    images taken indoor were n t so clear    you got to have flash   on   to get it eventhough your room is well litlens cap","    lens cap is a really annoying    go   get a high speed like lexar   x or higher cf card    else with simpler viking cf cards   it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately   fine     picture quality    image size         movie","    the movie clips taken will always have some   noise   in it   you can  t avoid that  camera","  within a year   there are problems with my menu dial knob    it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes  servicing","  i send my camera to nikon for servicing   took them a whole   weeks to diagnose the problem    worse of all   they claim that it  s some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty    they would n t repair my camera unless if i pay       for parts   and labor  camera","  it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality   but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service  ","  got a   system error   problem    days after purchase  camera","  made the camera totally inoperable  lens cap","  also   the lens cap design is flawed    you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it  audio","  audio on video also lacking  picture","      pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance  delay","","      the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture    all the above   i think   are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints    try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems    whichever camera you buy   add upto about     dollars for an additional memory card i bought a     mb card   usb card reader   camera bag and the warranty    and finally   get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra   no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness    hope this review has helped you in making up your mind    i have taken about     photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience    i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now  ","  focusing on a display rack about    feet away in a brightly lit room during day time   pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange    pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry    pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent    the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button   which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models    anyway   i ended up purchasing the lumix    i  m sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about    however   as an average person with unsteady hands   i doubt it  ll perform well in lower light settings  ","  the inside pics   can be a bit challenging   but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like   that are not focused perfectly   or need lighting adjustments   make this camera very simple and effective  feature","  the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too  download","  one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low    i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus  battery life","  it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long   especially if you use the flash a lot    so   it  s a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging  auto focus assist light","  it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light    i would say that this is not a major issue   but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things  optical zoom","  it has a  x optical zoom   which is average for these cameras    for more   you sacrifice weight and size   more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length    it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom   but you sacrifice quality    i set the camera to the   manual   mode for one main reason    in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries    in manual   you can set it to   single af   where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic   this is not really a hinderance   you just have to be familiar with its menus and features    in reality   these are the only drawbacks this camera has   much less than many other models    it is easy to   focus   in on the drawbacks   so do n t think i hate this camera  camera","  the only drawbacks i  ve encountered are     indoor shots from a distance    ft lack contrast and color   but i  ve found this to be a problem with all cameras with built in flashes that i  ve used even on a nikon slr    right now   i  m researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that  s designed for digital cameras  battery life","    the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations    i got    outdoor and    indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a   hour period before the battery died    an extra for a back up battery would be a good investment  software","    the picture editing software it came with is adequate   but not very robust    i  ll still use my photosuite for editing    one more thing about indoor shots   many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing    just for the heck of it   i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door   and the focusing was just fine  camera"]},

got a    mb card   and have been hard pressed to fill it over a weekend    the only drawbacks that i have noticed  battery","  it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general to

allows for pictures to be taken  camera","  i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down now buy it  ","  i have it for a week now   and this camera has exceeded my expectations  picture"," indoor shot","  the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about   feet away    the shutter lag is on par with what i  ve experienced with point and shoot   mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed   x    mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me   and it was only a few dollars more  image download","","  in summary   i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range      since i wrote the review above in january        i still love this camera    i  ve picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful    i bought a digi slave dsf  s flash unit    i do n t use a bracket   i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand    i also got a ur e   step down ring adapter   lc e     lens cap   and the nikon   mm filter set    this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters    i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time    this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap    the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on   the camera wo n t fit in the small cases   and   mm filters are expensive and hard to find  ","  great camera  use","  i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use  picture","  it takes great pictures  manual","  the manual is easy to understand   and it is mostly idiot proof  size","","  i got this camera about a month ago and i can  t put it down    i was considering buying the minolta f     and the sony dsc p     but at the camera shop   realized this one went above and beyond  picture quality","  i selected the      right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time  autofocus"," scene mode"," manual mode","  autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all    i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a     mb compact flash type i memory card    buy this camera and savour it  ","","  picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from   mm  indoor shot","  i am extremely satisfied with this camera    i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion    buy an extra battery   life is good but still somewhat short    do n t buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a     megabyte card    you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at   megapixel resolution    i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera  s controls are confusing and hard to remember    read the directions    the regular mode in this camera works for      of settings  scene mode","  the   scene   mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a   regular   setting    i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos  optical setting","  however   its  x optical setting is acceptable for      of the shots that i take    buy this camera   you wo n t regret it  "]
,"negative": ["      pictures wo n t transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable    i did everything i could   and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader    card reader is included        the speed is noticeably slower than canon   especially so with flashes on        with low battery   it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip    i used lexar     mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar    be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries  ","    this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can  t be stopped    would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing      if you want to have the date   time on the image   its only through their software   nikon view   which reads the images date   time from the images meta data    so if you use your card reader   copy images   you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date   time    in that too   there is n t a direct way to add date   time   you got to say   print images   to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date   time  image","    even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your imageindoor image","    images taken indoor were n t so clear    you got to have flash   on   to get it eventhough your room is well litlens cap","    lens cap is a really annoying    go   get a high speed like lexar   x or higher cf card    else with simpler viking cf cards   it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately   fine     picture quality    image size         movie","    the movie clips taken will always have some   noise   in it   you can  t avoid that  camera","  within a year   there are problems with my menu dial knob    it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes  servicing","  i send my camera to nikon for servicing   took them a whole   weeks to diagnose the problem    worse of all   they claim that it  s some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty    they would n t repair my camera unless if i pay       for parts   and labor  camera","  it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality   but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service  ","  got a   system error   problem    days after purchase  camera","  made the camera totally inoperable  lens cap","  also   the lens cap design is flawed    you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it  audio","  audio on video also lacking  picture","      pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance  delay","","      the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture    all the above   i think   are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints    try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems    whichever camera you buy   add upto about     dollars for an additional memory card i bought a     mb card   usb card reader   camera bag and the warranty    and finally   get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra   no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness    hope this review has helped you in making up your mind    i have taken about     photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience    i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now  ","  focusing on a display rack about    feet away in a brightly lit room during day time   pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange    pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry    pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent    the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button   which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models    anyway   i ended up purchasing the lumix    i  m sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about    however   as an average person with unsteady hands   i doubt it  ll perform well in lower light settings  ","  the inside pics   can be a bit challenging   but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like   that are not focused perfectly   or need lighting adjustments   make this camera very simple and effective  feature","  the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too  download","  one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low    i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus  battery life","  it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long   especially if you use the flash a lot    so   it  s a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging  auto focus assist light","  it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light    i would say that this is not a major issue   but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things  optical zoom","  it has a  x optical zoom   which is average for these cameras    for more   you sacrifice weight and size   more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length    it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom   but you sacrifice quality    i set the camera to the   manual   mode for one main reason    in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries    in manual   you can set it to   single af   where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic   this is not really a hinderance   you just have to be familiar with its menus and features    in reality   these are the only drawbacks this camera has   much less than many other models    it is easy to   focus   in on the drawbacks   so do n t think i hate this camera  camera","  the only drawbacks i  ve encountered are     indoor shots from a distance    ft lack contrast and color   but i  ve found this to be a problem with all cameras with built in flashes that i  ve used even on a nikon slr    right now   i  m researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that  s designed for digital cameras  battery life","    the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations    i got    outdoor and    indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a   hour period before the battery died    an extra for a back up battery would be a good investment  software","    the picture editing software it came with is adequate   but not very robust    i  ll still use my photosuite for editing    one more thing about indoor shots   many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing    just for the heck of it   i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door   and the focusing was just fine  camera","  on average   indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as   mm    however   the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures  camera"]},

,"negative": ["      pictures wo n t transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable    i did everything i could   and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader    card reader is included        the speed is noticeably slower than canon   especially so with flashes on        with low battery   it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip    i used lexar     mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar    be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries  ","    this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can  t be stopped    would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing      if you want to have the date   time on the image   its only through their software   nikon view   which reads the images date   time from the images meta data    so if you use your card reader   copy images   you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date   time    in that too   there is n t a direct way to add date   time   you got to say   print images   to a different

camera to nikon for servicing   took them a whole   weeks to diagnose the problem    worse of all   they claim that it  s some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty    they would n t repair my camera unless if i pay       for parts   and labor  camera","  it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality   but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service  ","  got a   system error   problem    days after purchase  camera","  made the camera totally inoperable  lens cap","  also   the lens cap design is flawed    you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it  audio","  audio on video also lacking  picture","      pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance  delay","","      the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture    all the above   i think   are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints    try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems    whichever camera you buy   add upto about     dollars for an additional memory card i bought a     mb card   usb card reader   camera bag and the warranty    and finally   get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra   no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness    hope this review has helped you in making up your mind    i have taken about     photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience    i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now  ","  focusing on a display rack about    feet away in a brightly lit room during day time   pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange    pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry    pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent    the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button   which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models    anyway   i ended up purchasing the lumix    i  m sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about    however   as an average person with unsteady hands   i doubt it  ll perform well in lower light settings  ","  the inside pics   can be a bit challenging   but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like   that are not focused perfectly   or need lighting

download","  one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low    i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus  battery life","  it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long   especially if you use the flash a lot    so   it  s a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging  auto focus assist light","  it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light    i would say that this is not a major issue   but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things  optical zoom","  it has a  x optical zoom   which is average for these cameras    for more   you sacrifice weight and size   more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length    it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom   but you sacrifice quality    i set the camera to the   manual   mode for one main reason    in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries    in manual   you can set it to   single af   where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic   this is not really a hinderance   you just have to be familiar with its menus and features    in reality   these are the only drawbacks this camera has   much less than many other models    it is easy to   focus   in on the drawbacks   so do n t think i hate this camera  camera","  the only drawbacks i  ve encountered are     indoor shots from a distance    ft lack contrast and color   but i  ve found this to be a problem with all cameras with built in flashes that i  ve used even on a nikon slr    right now   i  m researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that  s designed for digital cameras  battery life","    the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations    i got    outdoor and    indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a   hour period before the battery died    an extra for a back up battery would be a good investment  software","    the picture editing software it came with is adequate   but not very robust    i  ll still use my photosuite for editing    one more thing about indoor shots   many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing    just for the heck of it   i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door   and the focusing was just fine  camera","  on average   indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as

also got a ur e   step down ring adapter   lc e     lens cap   and the nikon   mm filter set    this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters    i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time    this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap    the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on   the camera wo n t fit in the small cases   and   mm filters are expensive and hard to find  ","  great camera  use","  i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use  picture","  it takes great

also got a ur e   step down ring adapter   lc e     lens cap   and the nikon   mm filter set    this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters    i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time    this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap    the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on

this camera has exceeded my expectations  picture"," indoor shot","  the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about   feet away    the shutter lag is on par with what i  ve experienced with point and shoot   mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed   x    mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me   and it was only a few dollars more  image download","","  in summary   i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range      since i wrote the review above in january        i still love this camera    i  ve picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful    i bought a digi slave dsf  s flash unit    i do n t use a bracket   i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand    i also got a ur e   step down ring adapter   lc e     lens cap   and the nikon   mm filter set    this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters    i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time    this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap    the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on   the camera wo n t fit in the small cases   and   mm filters are expensive and hard to find  ","  great camera  use","  i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use  picture","  it takes great pictures  manual","  the manual is easy to understand   and it is mostly idiot proof  size","","  i got this camera about a month ago and i can  t put it down    i was considering buying the minolta f

autofocus"," scene mode"," manual mode","  autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all    i would also recommend buying an extra

extremely satisfied with this camera    i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion    buy an extra battery   life is good but still somewhat short    do n t buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a     megabyte card    you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at   megapixel resolution    i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this

,"negative": ["      pictures wo n t transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable    i did everything i could   and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader    card reader is included        the speed is noticeably slower than canon   especially so with flashes on        with low battery   it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip    i used lexar     mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar    be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries  ","    this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can  t be stopped    would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing      if you want to have the date   time on the image   its only through their software   nikon view   which reads the images date   time from the images meta data    so if you use your card reader   copy images   you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date   time    in that too   there is n t a direct way to add date   time   you got to say   print images   to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date   time  image","    even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your imageindoor image","    images taken indoor were n t so clear    you got to have flash   on   to get it eventhough your room is well litlens cap","    lens cap is a really annoying    go   get a high speed like lexar   x or higher cf card    else with simpler viking cf cards   it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately   fine     picture quality    image size         movie","    the movie clips taken will always have some   noise   in it   you can  t avoid that  camera","  within a year   there are problems with my menu dial knob    it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes  servicing","  i send my camera to nikon for servicing   took them a whole   weeks to diagnose the problem    worse of all   they claim that it  s some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty    they would n t repair my camera unless if i pay       for parts   and labor  camera","  it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality   but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service  ","  got a   system error   problem    days after purchase  camera","  made the camera totally inoperable  lens cap","  also   the lens cap design is flawed    you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it  audio","  audio on video also lacking  picture","      pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance  delay","","      the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture    all the above   i think   are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints    try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems    whichever camera you buy   add upto about     dollars for an additional memory card i bought a     mb card   usb card reader   camera bag and the warranty    and finally   get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra   no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness    hope this review has helped you in making up your mind    i have taken about     photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience    i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now  ","  focusing on a display rack about    feet away in a brightly lit room during day time   pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange    pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry    pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent    the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button   which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models    anyway   i ended up purchasing the lumix    i  m sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about    however   as an average person with unsteady hands   i doubt it  ll perform well in lower light settings  ","  the inside pics   can be a bit challenging   but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like   that are not focused perfectly   or need lighting adjustments   make this camera very simple and effective  feature","  the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too  download","  one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low    i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus  battery life","  it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long   especially if you use the flash a lot    so   it  s a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging  auto focus assist light","  it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light    i would say that this is not a major issue   but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things  optical zoom","  it has a  x optical zoom   which is average for these cameras    for more   you sacrifice weight and size   more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length    it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom   but you sacrifice quality    i set the camera to the   manual   mode for one main reason    in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries    in manual   you can set it to   single af   where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic   this is not really a hinderance   you just have to be familiar with its menus and features    in reality   these are the only drawbacks this camera has   much less than many other models    it is easy to   focus   in on the drawbacks   so do n t think i hate this camera  camera","  the only drawbacks i  ve encountered are     indoor shots from a distance    ft lack contrast and color   but i  ve found this to be a problem with all cameras with built in flashes that i  ve used even on a nikon slr    right now   i  m researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that  s designed for digital cameras  battery life","    the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations    i got    outdoor and    indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a   hour period before the battery died    an extra for a back up battery would be a good investment  software","    the picture editing software it came with is adequate   but not very robust    i  ll still use my photosuite for editing    one more thing about indoor shots   many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing    just for the heck of it   i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door   and the focusing was just fine  camera","  on average   indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as   mm    however   the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures  camera","  i only have one complaint   and that is the  mb card included   mb","   mb for a camera like this is a joke    a card with more memory is a must    a minor quibble   since most cameras on the market still only include the  mb cards  ","    no direct firewire to the camera    there is usb   though  viewfinder","    the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the   mm wide angle    wc e      the optical viewfinder is partially obscured    this does n t affect the picture   of course    you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture    it  s no problem for me personally      battery has to be removed to recharge      an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery  s out is not included   although one can be purchased separately      two different adapters    ur e   and ur e      are required for some attachment lenses    most of these   annoyances     though   are comparable to what you  ll find on other cameras in this price range  "]},

have never had buyer  s remorse   mp"," optical zoom","    mp gives you room for the future gaining experience   cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera    x optical and the fact that it carries nikon  s quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price  picture","  one neat thing   i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms   no problem for the camera   rooms looked like they had ample lighting  ","  this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon  never knew i could love a digital camera so much  software","  online service","  the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat  clean clear and well focused on over      of all photos taken by a beginner          perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos    i took the camera and just gave it to someone    no instructions  photo","  just point and shoot and the photos were great    just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos  memory card","  the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla    my pda becames a digital album    i have a    mb card in it and can shoot over     hi res photos  camera","  if you have to buy a camera on a buget  this has got to be the one    go get it    before they are sold out  ","  great camera   i have been using this for several months and got excellent results

   i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it  ","  great camera   and for the price you can  t beat it    i  ve been using it for about   months now  control","  i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly  quality","  the quality is superb  size","  the small size is perfect for my little hands   but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person  ","  the      is a very durable   compact package   and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust    it comes with a   mb flash card that you will need to upgrade    we got a    mb card   and have been hard pressed to fill it over a weekend    the only drawbacks that i have noticed  battery","  it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general to moderate snapping    for work   we use them in the field often   and they hold up really well  macro","  they take excellent macro shots as well  menu","  the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access   and it takes silent movies  ","  i compared this to a lot of other cameras   believe me   it  s value for money  picture","  the picturers are amazing    do n t waste time looking at anything else   just buy this one    it do n t get any better then the nikon       "," function","  recently bought this coolpix      along with a    mb ultra flash card   as expected   i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with  m  m pixel   fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models   and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately  txt file","  i particularly like the   txt   file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take size","","  a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories   as always  "," picture","  i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n t take weeks to figure out how to operate  picture quality","  we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken  camera","  i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down now buy it  ","  i have it for a week now   and this camera has exceeded my expectations  picture"," indoor shot","  the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about   feet away    the shutter lag is on par with what i  ve experienced with point and shoot   mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed   x    mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me   and it was only a few dollars more  image download","","  in summary   i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range      since i wrote the review above in january        i still love this camera    i  ve picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful    i bought a digi slave dsf  s flash unit    i do n t use a bracket   i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand    i also got a ur e   step down ring adapter   lc e     lens cap   and the nikon   mm filter set    this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters    i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time    this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap    the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on   the camera wo n t fit in the small cases   and   mm filters are expensive and hard to find  ","  great camera  use","  i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use  picture","  it takes great pictures  manual","  the manual is easy to understand   and it is mostly idiot proof  size","","  i got this camera about a month ago and i can  t put it down    i was considering buying the minolta f     and the sony dsc p     but at the camera shop   realized this one went above and beyond  picture quality","  i selected the      right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time  autofocus"," scene mode"," manual mode","  autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all    i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a     mb compact flash type i memory card    buy this camera and savour it  ","","  picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from   mm  indoor shot","  i am extremely satisfied with this camera    i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion    buy an extra battery   life is good but still somewhat short    do n t buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a     megabyte card    you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at   megapixel resolution    i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera  s controls are confusing and hard to remember    read the directions    the regular mode in this camera works for      of settings  scene mode","  the   scene   mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a   regular   setting    i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos  optical setting","  however   its  x optical setting is acceptable for      of the shots that i take    buy this camera   you wo n t regret it  ","  if you  re looking for a small   compact   super resolution digital camera   you can end your search with the nikon       picture quality","  after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded   high performance   travel size camera   i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality   mega pixel  nikon","  after using it for about a month   i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck  use","  accessory","  its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake  picture quality"," feature","  yes   the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range  design"," construction"," optic","  the design and construction are excellent    as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics    i own a   mm slr camera and this is my second digital    if you  re seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer  s remorse and filled with cool   then travel to the world of the coolpix       ","  there are so many functions in this little   yet powerful camera  ","","  but this camera is great  picture quality"," movie","  the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to    i can  t connect it to my computer though   but that  s a problem with windows me   not the camera    if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway   lol    but it works perfectly fine on my parent  s computer  lense cap","  it does have a lense cap   but it wo n t let you take pics with it on which is real good  battery","  the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice  camera","  ooh   and i dropped it and it still works fine   this little camera has so many features i have n t even gotten to all of them yet  "," feature","  camera","  it  s easy for beginners to use   but has features

photo enthusiast would want  use","    it is easy enough for my grandmother to use  size","","    it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they  re still easy to use      it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms      for   digital film   it uses compact flash cards   which are easy to find   cheap   reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at

,"negative": ["      pictures wo n t transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable    i did everything i could   and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader    card reader is included        the speed is noticeably slower than canon   especially so with flashes on        with low battery   it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip    i used lexar     mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar    be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries  ","    this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can  t be stopped    would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing      if you want to have the date   time on the image   its only through their software   nikon view   which reads the images date   time from the images meta data    so if you use your card reader   copy images   you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date   time    in that too   there is n t a direct way to add date   time   you got to say   print images   to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date   time  image","    even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your imageindoor image","    images taken indoor were n t so clear    you got to have flash   on   to get it eventhough your room is well litlens cap","    lens cap is a really annoying    go   get a high speed like lexar   x or higher cf card    else with simpler viking cf cards   it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately   fine     picture quality    image size         movie","    the movie clips taken will always have some   noise   in it   you can  t avoid that  camera","  within a year   there are problems with my menu dial knob    it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes  servicing","  i send my camera to nikon for servicing   took them a whole   weeks to diagnose the problem    worse of all   they claim that it  s some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty    they would n t repair my camera unless if i pay       for parts   and labor  camera","  it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality   but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service  ","  got a   system error   problem    days after purchase  camera","  made the camera totally inoperable  lens cap","  also   the lens cap design is flawed    you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it  audio","  audio on video also lacking  picture","      pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance  delay","","      the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture    all the above   i think   are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints    try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems    whichever camera you buy   add upto about     dollars for an additional memory card i bought a     mb card   usb card reader   camera bag and the warranty    and finally   get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra   no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness    hope this review has helped you in making up your mind    i have taken about     photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience    i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now  ","  focusing on a display rack about    feet away in a brightly lit room during day time   pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange    pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry    pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent    the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button   which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models    anyway   i ended up purchasing the lumix    i  m sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about    however   as an average person with unsteady hands   i doubt it  ll perform well in lower light settings  ","  the inside pics   can be a bit challenging   but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like   that are not focused perfectly   or need lighting adjustments   make this camera very simple and effective  feature","  the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too  download","  one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low    i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus  battery life","  it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long   especially if you use the flash a lot    so   it  s a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging  auto focus assist light","  it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light    i would say that this is not a major issue   but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things  optical zoom","  it has a  x optical zoom   which is average for these cameras    for more   you sacrifice weight and size   more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length    it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom   but you sacrifice quality    i set the camera to the   manual   mode for one main reason    in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries    in manual   you can set it to   single af   where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic   this is not really a hinderance   you just have to be familiar with its menus and features    in reality   these are the only drawbacks this camera has   much less than many other models    it is easy to   focus   in on the drawbacks   so do n t think i hate this camera  camera","  the only drawbacks i  ve encountered are     indoor shots from a distance    ft lack contrast and color   but i  ve found this to be a problem with all cameras with built in flashes that i  ve used even on a nikon slr    right now   i  m researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that  s designed for digital cameras  battery life","    the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations    i got    outdoor and    indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a   hour period before the battery died    an extra for a back up battery would be a good investment  software","    the picture editing software it came with is adequate   but not very robust    i  ll still use my photosuite for editing    one more thing about indoor shots   many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing    just for the heck of it   i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door   and the focusing was just fine  camera","  on average   indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as   mm    however   the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures  camera","  i only have one complaint   and that is the  mb card included   mb","   mb for a camera like this is a joke    a card with more memory is a must    a minor quibble   since most cameras on the market still only include the  mb cards  ","    no direct firewire to the camera    there is usb   though  viewfinder","    the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the   mm wide angle    wc e      the optical viewfinder is partially obscured    this does n t affect the picture   of course    you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture    it  s no problem for me personally      battery has to be removed to recharge      an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery  s out is not included   although one can be purchased separately      two different adapters    ur e   and ur e      are required for some attachment lenses    most of these   annoyances     though   are comparable to what you  ll find on other cameras in this price range  "]},

awkward for a bigger person  ","  the      is a very durable   compact package   and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust    it comes with a   mb flash card that you will need to upgrade    we got a    mb card   and have been hard pressed to fill it over a weekend    the only drawbacks that i have noticed  battery","  it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general to moderate snapping    for work   we use them in the field often   and they hold up really well  macro","  they take excellent macro shots as well  menu","  the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access   and it takes silent movies  ","  i compared this to a lot of other cameras   believe me   it  s value for money  picture","  the picturers are amazing    do n t waste time looking at anything else   just buy this one    it do n t get any better then the nikon       "," function","  recently bought this coolpix      along with a    mb ultra flash card   as expected   i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with  m  m pixel   fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models   and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately  txt file","  i particularly like the   txt   file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take size","","  a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories   as always  "," picture","  i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n t take weeks to figure out how to operate  picture quality","  we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken  camera","  i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down now buy it  ","  i have it for a week now   and this camera has exceeded my expectations  picture"," indoor shot","  the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about   feet away    the shutter lag is on par with what i  ve experienced with point and shoot   mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed   x    mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me   and it was only a few dollars more  image download","","  in summary   i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range      since i wrote the review above in january        i still love this camera    i  ve picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful    i bought a digi slave dsf  s flash unit    i do n t use a bracket   i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand    i also got a ur e   step down ring adapter   lc e     lens cap   and the nikon   mm filter set    this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters    i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time    this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap    the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on   the camera wo n t fit in the small cases   and   mm filters are expensive and hard to find  ","  great camera  use","  i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use  picture","  it takes great pictures  manual","  the manual is easy to understand   and it is mostly idiot proof  size","","  i got this camera about a month ago and i can  t put it down    i was considering buying the minolta f     and the sony dsc p     but at the camera shop   realized this one went above and beyond  picture quality","  i selected the      right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time  autofocus"," scene mode"," manual mode","  autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all    i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a     mb compact flash type i memory card    buy this camera and savour it  ","","  picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from   mm  indoor shot","  i am extremely satisfied with this camera    i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion    buy an extra battery   life is good but still somewhat short    do n t buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a     megabyte card    you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at   megapixel resolution    i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera  s controls are confusing and hard to remember    read the directions    the regular mode in this camera works for      of settings  scene mode","  the   scene   mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a   regular   setting    i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos  optical setting","  however   its  x optical setting is acceptable for      of the shots that i take    buy this camera   you wo n t regret it  ","  if you  re looking for a small   compact   super resolution digital camera   you can end your search with the nikon       picture quality","  after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded   high performance   travel size camera   i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality   mega pixel  nikon","  after using it for about a month   i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck  use","  accessory","  its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake  picture quality"," feature","  yes   the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range  design"," construction"," optic","  the design and construction are excellent    as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics    i own a   mm slr camera and this is my second digital    if you  re seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer  s remorse and filled with cool   then travel to the world of the coolpix       ","  there are so many functions in this little   yet powerful camera  ","","  but this camera is great  picture quality"," movie","  the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to    i can  t connect it to my computer though   but that  s a problem with windows me   not the camera    if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway   lol    but it works perfectly fine on my parent  s computer  lense cap","  it does have a lense cap   but it wo n t let you take pics with it on which is real good  battery","  the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice  camera","  ooh   and i dropped it and it still works fine   this little camera has so many features i have n t even gotten to all of them yet  "," feature","  camera","  it  s easy for beginners to use   but has features that more serious photographers will love   so it  s an excellent camera to grow into  weight","  picture","","  i love the continuous shot mode   which allows you to take up to    pix in rapid succession    great for action shots  photo quality"," print","  i  m amazed at the photo quality    prints are indistinguishable from   mm prints   mb card","    it has all the features an amatuer photo enthusiast would want  use","    it is easy enough for my grandmother to use  size","","    it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they  re still easy to use      it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms      for   digital film   it uses compact flash cards   which are easy to find   cheap   reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome  nikon support","    the nikon coolpix line is a well established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model  picture quality","    picture quality is excellent  battery life","    battery life is excellent  optical zoom","     x built in optical zoom is a lot for this price range  price","     great price for all the features    here  s what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera  firewire",""," image","  this camera was affordable   very easy to learn   and produces spectacular images  auto mode"," scene mode"," manual mode","  the auto mode is good enough for most shots but the      also boasts    versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n t played with it too much on manual  size","  it  s size also makes it ideal for travel  camera","  overall the nikon      is a very dependable   robust   and useful little camera  ","  print quality","  awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package  closeup mode","  battery","  the same  mp chip from the      camera   plus a  x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders   great closeup mode   long lasting

images  "]
,"negative": ["      pictures wo n t transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable    i did everything i could   and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader    card reader is included        the speed is noticeably slower than canon   especially so with flashes on        with low battery   it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip    i used lexar     mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar    be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries  ","    this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can  t be stopped    would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing      if you want to have the date   time on the image   its only through their software   nikon view   which reads the images date   time from the images meta data    so if you use your card reader   copy images   you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date   time    in that too   there is n t a direct way to add date   time   you got to say   print images   to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date   time  image","    even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your imageindoor image","    images taken indoor were n t so clear    you got to have flash   on   to get it eventhough your room is well litlens cap","    lens cap is a really annoying    go   get a high speed like lexar   x or higher cf card    else with simpler viking cf cards   it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately   fine     picture quality    image size         movie","    the movie clips taken will always have some   noise   in it   you can  t avoid that  camera","  within a year   there are problems with my menu dial knob    it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes  servicing","  i send my camera to nikon for servicing   took them a whole   weeks to diagnose the problem    worse of all   they claim that it  s some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty    they would n t repair my camera unless if i pay       for parts   and labor  camera","  it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality   but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service  ","  got a   system error   problem    days after purchase  camera","  made the camera totally inoperable  lens cap","  also   the lens cap design is flawed    you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it  audio","  audio on video also lacking  picture","      pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance  delay","","      the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture    all the above   i think   are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints    try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems    whichever camera you buy   add upto about     dollars for an additional memory card i bought a     mb card   usb card reader   camera bag and the warranty    and finally   get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra   no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness    hope this review has helped you in making up your mind    i have taken about     photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience    i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now  ","  focusing on a display rack about    feet away in a brightly lit room during day time   pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange    pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry    pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent    the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button   which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models    anyway   i ended up purchasing the lumix    i  m sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about    however   as an average person with unsteady hands   i doubt it  ll perform well in lower light settings  ","  the inside pics   can be a bit challenging   but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like   that are not focused perfectly   or need lighting adjustments   make this camera very simple and effective  feature","  the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too  download","  one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low    i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus  battery life","  it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long   especially if you use the flash a lot    so   it  s a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging  auto focus assist light","  it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light    i would say that this is not a major issue   but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things  optical zoom","  it has a  x optical zoom   which is average for these cameras    for more   you sacrifice weight and size   more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length    it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom   but you sacrifice quality    i set the camera to the   manual   mode for one main reason    in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries    in manual   you can set it to   single af   where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic   this is not really a hinderance   you just have to be familiar with its menus and features    in reality   these are the only drawbacks this camera has   much less than many other models    it is easy to   focus   in on the drawbacks   so do n t think i hate this camera  camera","  the only drawbacks i  ve encountered are     indoor shots from a distance    ft lack contrast and color   but i  ve found this to be a problem with all cameras with built in flashes that i  ve used even on a nikon slr    right now   i  m researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that  s designed for digital cameras  battery life","    the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations    i got    outdoor and    indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a   hour period before the battery died    an extra for a back up battery would be a good investment  software","    the picture editing software it came with is adequate   but not very robust    i  ll still use my photosuite for editing    one more thing about indoor shots   many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing    just for the heck of it   i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door   and the focusing was just fine  camera","  on average   indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as   mm    however   the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures  camera","  i only have one complaint   and that is the  mb card included   mb","   mb for a camera like this is a joke    a card with more memory is a must    a minor quibble   since most cameras on the market still only include the  mb cards  ","    no direct firewire to the camera    there is usb   though  viewfinder","    the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the   mm wide angle    wc e      the optical viewfinder is partially obscured    this does n t affect the picture   of course    you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture    it  s no problem for me personally      battery has to be removed to recharge      an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery  s out is not included   although one can be purchased separately      two different adapters    ur e   and ur e      are required for some attachment lenses    most of these   annoyances     though   are comparable to what you  ll find on other cameras in this price range  "]}
