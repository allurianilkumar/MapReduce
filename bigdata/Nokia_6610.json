warranty you should be able to swap it out  game","  games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games  ","  buttons do seem a little sticky tho    and the hands free kits   connector might be a problem   ","  the keys are close together   and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads   but it  s not too weird

some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient  menu option","  the menu options appear one at a time   taking up the whole screen   and one has to scroll down one by one   or have memorized where they are in the menu order   to select them by using the number keypad    thumbs down on that one  vibrate setting","  the vibrate setting is loud  vibrate setting",""," headset

can  t say much about the motorolla    all these phones have color screens   polymorphic tones   and are internet ready    in music tones department the      has    chords   thats number of different

the keypad is a decent size   but the power on off key is small and difficult to press  battery life","  in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side mounted volume control    it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone  headphone jack","  one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia   so standard headphones will not work  phone","  one complaint     the screen is too easily scratched    but there are faceplates to replace it i guess      almost there    i got this phone in t mobile  s current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal    i was getting so sick of my old motorola l       but was waiting for the right phone to come along    this is almost it but not quite but the price was right

warranty you should be able to swap it out  game","  games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games  ","  buttons do seem a little sticky tho    and the hands free kits   connector might be a problem   ","  the keys are close together   and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads   but it  s not too weird

the keypad is a decent size   but the power on off key is small and difficult to press  battery life","  in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side mounted volume control    it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone  headphone jack","  one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia   so standard headphones will not work  phone","  one complaint     the screen is too easily scratched    but there are faceplates to replace it i guess      almost there    i got this phone in t mobile  s current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal    i was getting so sick of my old motorola l       but was waiting for the right phone to come along    this is almost it but not quite but the price was right

think it makes a difference      anyways there are ways to set up your      to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net   being able to download pics and ringtones   not

think it makes a difference      anyways there are ways to set up your      to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net   being able to download pics and ringtones   not

compared to the toy phone design of the nokia      with its cheap feel  weight","","  the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there    one thing that i found out recently is that you do n t need t zones from tmobile to go online    every t mobile plan comes with gsm data   meaning that instead of speeds of    kbps is around   kbps   with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference      anyways there are ways to set up your      to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net   being able to download pics and ringtones   not java apps   you need t zones for that      tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia      and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans    if you thought about getting this phone buy it  phone","  this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities  ","  it does well in all aspects of internet browsing    as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it  "]

are not as crisp as i  d have liked them to be    however   it serves its purpose  backlight","  the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly   dangerous when you  re driving at night     and there  s no way to change this     i checked with nokia  button","  the buttons on the phone are small   even for my small fingertips   but you get used to them rather quickly  menu options","  the menu options are uncreative   as you can  t see a full screen of menu items to pick from   you have to scroll up and down to find what you  re looking for   yes   this is minor   but not when you  re trying to keep your eye on the road        more downside to this phone  volume","  the volume    oh my goodness   volume","  i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially

to my service   duh     so that took another     days of figuring out  customer rep","  however   the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega static   to the point where i  d have to dial numbers     times to get a clear line    and no t zones    so what  s the point  sprint","  the volume level of the phone is not all that good  ring","  some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear   but not easy to listen to  tone","  the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times  vibration","  the vibration is not top    it is a teeny phone   so it is hard to put a big mechanism in    i do n t use the vibration   because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it    vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this    so it was no loss  phone","","","  radio is awsome   but it does n t work unless you have the earpice in    that is a major minus   but its not that bad  t mobile","","  it also does n t have voice

much help i can get from amazon and report back  ","  when i got it home   i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n t there    it defaulted to unchangeable email    so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support   only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem    i returned to the store

feature once the person you are calling answers the phone   not while it is ringing    the radio  radio","  the only problem i had was a small glitch with t mobile  reception"," high speed internet","  the phone has a few minor inconveniences   but only because it lacks those features   bluetooth and high spend internet   but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do  phone","  ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings   there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring  screen","  the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out  game","  games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games  ","  buttons do seem a little sticky tho    and the hands free kits   connector might be a problem   ","  the keys are close together   and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads   but it  s not too weird  key","  the fact that the       key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing   as many phones use the       key instead    but that  s not an insurmoutable obstacle  screen","  there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient  menu option","  the menu options appear one at a time   taking up the whole screen   and one has to scroll down one by one   or have memorized where they are in the menu order   to select them by using the number keypad    thumbs down on that one  vibrate setting","  the vibrate setting is loud  vibrate setting",""," headset jack","  other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard     mm headset jack    i  d like a camera phone   but i  d rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no

hard to press   but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw   perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call  pc cable","  pc cable is too expensive          for a usb cable    please    is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software  ","  the      has the radio function which is utterly useless  application","  it also has a stock tracking app built in   also useless   and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics   currency   length   area   etc      the s      samsung   has a beautiful big display          colors     and i can  t say much about the motorolla    all these phones have color screens   polymorphic tones   and are internet ready    in music tones department the      has    chords   thats number of different instruments which it can play   i think   the samsung i think have      i donno about the other phones but i feel the t    has the best sounding ring tones  software","  regarding pc software support

thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features   but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone    as i travel quite a lot   i  d want something with

being replaced with the new samsung x       you do take your chances with this phone  ","  although i find it more convenient to use   touch dialing   this phone does not have voice dialing  key","  the keypad is a decent size   but the power on off key is small and difficult to press  battery life","  in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side mounted volume control    it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone  headphone jack","  one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia   so standard headphones will not work  phone","  one complaint     the screen is too easily scratched    but there are faceplates to replace it i guess      almost there    i got this phone in t mobile  s current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal    i was getting so sick of my old motorola l       but was waiting for the right phone to come along    this is almost it but not quite but the price was right    that said this phone does what it does extremely well   way better than anything motorola can produce  battery life","  one more thing   the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible

the keypad is a decent size   but the power on off key is small and difficult to press  battery life","  in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side mounted volume control    it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone  headphone jack","  one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia   so standard headphones will not work  phone","  one complaint     the screen is too easily scratched    but there are faceplates to replace it i guess      almost there    i got this phone in t mobile  s current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal    i was getting so sick of my old motorola l       but was waiting for the right phone to come along    this is almost it but not quite but the price was right    that said this phone does what it does extremely well   way better than anything motorola can produce  battery life","  one more thing   the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible  phone","  the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls   real estate broker software   very well at all    i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t mobile   hot spots    browsing","  i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing    i do n t really like bounce    i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones  battery life","  my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons    nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad   which imho is totally unnecessary  key","  this model does have the traditional key arrangement   it  s just that they are really close to one another   and have unconventional shapes   so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands      to be fair   the same can be said about many korean imports   and the nokia  s build quality is light years ahead of the koreans    phone","  finally   i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier  t mobile","  their network coverage is very sporadic   and the network always seems overloaded   resulting in very unpleasant calling experience    if you can get this phone for cingular or at t   go with the other carriers  "]},

compared to the toy phone design of the nokia      with its cheap feel  weight","","  the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there    one thing that i found out recently is that you do n t need t zones from tmobile to go online    every t mobile plan comes with gsm data   meaning that instead of speeds of    kbps is around   kbps   with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference      anyways there are ways to set up your      to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net   being able to download pics and ringtones   not java apps   you need t zones for that      tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia      and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans    if you thought about getting this phone buy it  phone","  this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities  ","  it does well in all aspects of

you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing  screen"," sound","  great screen and great sound    ok   everybody loves the fm radio in this   but you want a cell

other than that   this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips  t mobile","  the nokia      is a relatively new phone   and what a great phone it is    when i first saw the        i thought it was too small  size","  after using it   i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket  earpiece","  it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder   but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear piece which is included    the ear piece has a button that answers and hangs up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all   unless dialing a number  voice dialing","  when i turned the phone on   the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is  resolution","  color","  the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable    the phone has several color schemes you can choose from    i like the default blue    you can also set a background wallpaper  ringtone","  the ringtones included are awesome   and did i mention they were polyphonic    no more annoying series of beeps    this phone plays up to   tones at one time and it actually sounds like music  ring","  you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call    the massive phonebook can hold     entries   with multiple phone number per entry   so you can program your boss  s home   work and cellphone numbers all under one contact  phone","  the phone also sports an image gallery   with option camera attachment     a calendar   organizer   alarm clock with snooze   fm radio   way cool   even if it is just through an ear peice     games   java applications and gprs high speed internet connection  gprs","  the gprs connection is sometimes slow   and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain   but the other t zones applications are quite useful    you can get weather   movies   horoscopes and more with a few clicks    the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code   but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go  t zone","","  the rate plans are also very good   at least for me    different people have different needs   of course   but the t mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive    the phone would have received   stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t zones worked  phone","  this phone is highly recommended otherwise  "]

resulting in very unpleasant calling experience    if you can get this phone for cingular or at t   go with the other carriers  ","  unfortunately   the      does not offer voice dialing like my

think it makes a difference      anyways there are ways to set up your      to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net   being able to download pics and ringtones   not

the koreans    phone","  finally   i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier  t mobile","  their network coverage is very sporadic   and the network always seems overloaded   resulting in very unpleasant calling experience    if you can get this phone for cingular or at t   go with the other carriers  ","  unfortunately   the      does not offer voice dialing like my

been assured this will be fixed soon    now   for the t mobile service    i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones    if you have a question   they have the answer    and should they not know it   they can find it out pretty quick    every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone  t mobile service","  the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have    one of the things t mobile brags about is the fact that it  s a   worldphone   and can be used in europe   etc   yet they  ve gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone   including italian   german   and dutch  internet","  the internet functions of the phone   wap and gprs   will only work through t mobile  s services   because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure

or internet    after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another   i got fed up and have decided to return the phone    bottom line   if you  re attracted to this phone because of its tri band feature so you can take it abroad   forget it    find another phone   or buy this one in its manufacturer unlocked form  "]},

do  phone","  ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings   there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring  screen","  the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out  game","  games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games  ","  buttons do seem a little sticky tho    and the hands free kits   connector might be a problem   ","  the keys are close together   and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads   but it  s not too weird  key","  the fact that the       key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing   as many phones use the       key instead    but that  s not an insurmoutable obstacle  screen","  there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient  menu option","  the menu options appear one at a time   taking up the whole screen   and one has to scroll down one by one   or have memorized where they are in the menu order   to select them by using the number keypad    thumbs down on that one  vibrate setting","  the vibrate setting is loud  vibrate setting",""," headset jack","  other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard     mm headset jack    i  d like a camera phone   but i  d rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls      pros  weight","    some features in the user interfacevoice dialing","    no voice activated dialing   what were they thinkingpicture","  ringtone","    no option for caller id pictures or individualized ringtones  headset jack","    no propietary headset jack","  only if we could get one camera in it      it did have scored over all other competitors     phone","  the volume key can be hard to press   but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw   perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call  pc cable","  pc cable is too expensive          for a usb cable    please    is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software  ","  the      has the radio function which is utterly useless  application","  it also has a stock tracking app built in   also useless   and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics   currency   length   area   etc      the s      samsung   has a beautiful big display          colors     and i can  t say much about the motorolla    all these phones have color screens   polymorphic tones   and are internet ready    in music tones department the      has    chords   thats number of different instruments which it can play   i think   the samsung i think have      i donno about the other phones but i feel the t    has the best sounding ring tones  software","  regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop    i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft    oh well   phone","  i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features   but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone    as i travel quite a lot   i  d want something with gsm as well as cdma tri band  phone",""," volume","  i do here a constant high pitched distorted sound   not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough    it  s going back today         being replaced with the new samsung x       you do take your chances with this phone  ","  although i find it more convenient to use   touch dialing   this phone does not have voice dialing  key","  the keypad is a decent size   but the power on off key is small and difficult to press  battery life","  in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side mounted volume control    it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone  headphone jack","  one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia   so standard headphones will not work  phone","  one complaint     the screen is too easily scratched    but there are faceplates to replace it i guess      almost there    i got this phone in t mobile  s current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal    i was getting so sick of my old motorola l       but was waiting for the right phone to come along    this is almost it but not quite but the price was right    that said this phone does what it does extremely well   way better than anything motorola can produce  battery life","  one more thing   the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible  phone","  the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls   real estate broker software   very well at all    i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t mobile   hot spots    browsing","  i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing    i do n t really like bounce    i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones  battery life","  my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons    nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad   which imho is totally unnecessary  key","  this model does have the traditional key arrangement   it  s just that they are really close to one another   and have unconventional shapes   so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands      to be fair   the same can be said about many korean imports   and the nokia  s build quality is light years ahead of the koreans    phone","  finally   i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier  t mobile","  their network coverage is very sporadic   and the network always seems overloaded   resulting in very unpleasant calling experience    if you can get this phone for cingular or at t   go with the other carriers  ","  unfortunately   the      does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone   but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming  screen"," t zone","  one downside   as of this writing   t mobile has n t updated their t zone system to fully support the         their website does not show it as a compatible phone   and should i try to access the game downloads on t zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported    i have been assured this will be fixed soon    now   for the t mobile service    i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones    if you have a question   they have the answer    and should they not know it   they can find it out pretty quick    every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone  t mobile service","  the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have    one of the things t mobile brags about is the fact that it  s a   worldphone   and can be used in europe   etc   yet they  ve gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone   including italian   german   and dutch  internet","  the internet functions of the phone   wap and gprs   will only work through t mobile  s services   because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network    therefore   if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card   even if you unlock the phone   there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet    after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another   i got fed up and have decided to return the phone    bottom line   if you  re attracted to this phone because of its tri band feature so you can take it abroad   forget it    find another phone   or buy this one in its manufacturer unlocked form  ","  however   the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality    it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier  voice","  when talking the voice is not very clear  phone"]},

other than that   this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips  t mobile","  the nokia      is a relatively new phone   and what a great phone it is    when i first saw the        i thought it was too small  size","  after using it   i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket  earpiece","  it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder   but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear piece which is included    the ear piece has a button that answers and hangs up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all   unless dialing a number  voice dialing","  when i turned the phone on   the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is  resolution","  color","  the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable    the phone has several color schemes you can choose from    i like the default blue    you can also set a background wallpaper  ringtone","  the ringtones included are awesome   and did i mention they were polyphonic    no more annoying series of beeps    this phone plays up to   tones at one time and it actually sounds like music  ring","  you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call    the massive phonebook can hold     entries   with multiple phone number per entry   so you can program your boss  s home   work and cellphone numbers all under one contact  phone","  the phone also sports an image gallery   with option camera attachment     a calendar   organizer   alarm clock with snooze   fm radio   way cool   even if it is just through an ear peice     games   java applications and gprs high speed internet connection  gprs","  the gprs connection is sometimes slow   and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain   but the other t zones applications are quite useful    you can get weather   movies   horoscopes and more with a few clicks    the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code   but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go  t zone","","  the rate plans are also very good   at least for me    different people have different needs   of course   but the t mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive    the phone would have received   stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t zones worked  phone","  this phone is highly recommended otherwise  ","  nokia makes a great phone   that  s clear  menu","  feature","  with all its complicated features   the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great  menu","  feature","  this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it    i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then      i did n t had any problem till now  design"," screen","  the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution  weight"," signal","  it is very light weight and has a good signal strength  sound quality","  but   i would definately recommend this phone    go for it    ","","  this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made    i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks    there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free  "]
,"negative": ["  after several years of torture in the hands of at t customer service i am delighted to drop them   and look forward to august      when i will convert our other   family phones from at t to t mobile  signal quality","  the day finally arrived when i was sure i  d leave sprint  sprint plan"," sprint customer service","  after years with that carrier  s expensive plans and horrible customer service   portability seemed heaven sent    i  d always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t mobile   so i gave it a whirl  size","  i spent hours setting up the stations   accepts about         i believe     though the reception is unpredictable    also   you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious  sound volume","  the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine  ringtone","  the phone comes with okay ringtones   some decent backgrounds   screensavers   but the phone has very little memory   mine had    kb as it arrived from amazon   so you do n t have too many options on what you can put on there    color","  the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i  d have liked them to be    however   it serves its purpose  backlight","  the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly   dangerous when you  re driving at night     and there  s no way to change this     i checked with nokia  button","  the buttons on the phone are small   even for my small fingertips   but you get used to them rather quickly  menu options","  the menu options are uncreative   as you can  t see a full screen of menu items to pick from   you have to scroll up and down to find what you  re looking for   yes   this is minor   but not when you  re trying to keep your eye on the road        more downside to this phone  volume","  the volume    oh my goodness   volume","  i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet    forget talking on it in public    you just can  t hear the other person  battery life","  i assumed they had exceptional service   but their reception in my area   los angeles   is horrendous    reason    they piggy back on cingular  s service  t zone","  also   their t zones   although cheap            mo    never works  customer service","  since i received the phone   i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t zones would work   in    hours    t zone","  i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of   weeks   when t zones never worked       hours    by what time standards    martian  t mobile","  apparently   t mobile is heavily back logged and can  t keep up with demands    also   they  d forgotten to add   wap   capability to my service   duh     so that took another     days of figuring out  customer rep","  however   the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega static   to the point where i  d have to dial numbers     times to get a clear line    and no t zones    so what  s the point  sprint","  the volume level of the phone is not all that good  ring","  some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear   but not easy to listen to  tone","  the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times  vibration","  the vibration is not top    it is a teeny phone   so it is hard to put a big mechanism in    i do n t use the vibration   because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it    vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this    so it was no loss  phone","","","  radio is awsome   but it does n t work unless you have the earpice in    that is a major minus   but its not that bad  t mobile","","  it also does n t have voice activated dialing   big minus    phone","  this is a very nice phone   but there is no warranty on it    nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon  phone","  we got two phones for the t mobile family plan   indeed very easy to switch to the family plan   and one came with a broken headphone   can hear but cannot be heard   and one died today after less than two weeks of use    i  ll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back  ","  when i got it home   i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n t there    it defaulted to unchangeable email    so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support   only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem    i returned to the store   whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work   he could n t    he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support   to no avail    so i had to give up and return it   having lost about   hours  sound quality","","","  negative   impossibly tiny and difficult to operate   barely visible   power button  key","  poor visibility on the keys    you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them  ","  only con i can think of is no camera        no big deal for the size    phone","  only one complaint about the speakerphone   you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone   not while it is ringing    the radio  radio","  the only problem i had was a small glitch with t mobile  reception"," high speed internet","  the phone has a few minor inconveniences   but only because it lacks those features   bluetooth and high spend internet   but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do  phone","  ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings   there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring  screen","  the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out  game","  games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games  ","  buttons do seem a little sticky tho    and the hands free kits   connector might be a problem   ","  the keys are close together   and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads   but it  s not too weird  key","  the fact that the       key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing   as many phones use the       key instead    but that  s not an insurmoutable obstacle  screen","  there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient  menu option","  the menu options appear one at a time   taking up the whole screen   and one has to scroll down one by one   or have memorized where they are in the menu order   to select them by using the number keypad    thumbs down on that one  vibrate setting","  the vibrate setting is loud  vibrate setting",""," headset jack","  other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard     mm headset jack    i  d like a camera phone   but i  d rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls      pros  weight","    some features in the user interfacevoice dialing","    no voice activated dialing   what were they thinkingpicture","  ringtone","    no option for caller id pictures or individualized ringtones  headset jack","    no propietary headset jack","  only if we could get one camera in it      it did have scored over all other competitors     phone","  the volume key can be hard to press   but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw   perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call  pc cable","  pc cable is too expensive          for a usb cable    please    is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software  ","  the      has the radio function which is utterly useless  application","  it also has a stock tracking app built in   also useless   and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics   currency   length   area   etc      the s      samsung   has a beautiful big display          colors     and i can  t say much about the motorolla    all these phones have color screens   polymorphic tones   and are internet ready    in music tones department the      has    chords   thats number of different instruments which it can play   i think   the samsung i think have      i donno about the other phones but i feel the t    has the best sounding ring tones  software","  regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop    i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft    oh well   phone","  i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features   but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone    as i travel quite a lot   i  d want something with gsm as well as cdma tri band  phone",""," volume","  i do here a constant high pitched distorted sound   not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough    it  s going back today         being replaced with the new samsung x       you do take your chances with this phone  ","  although i find it more convenient to use   touch dialing   this phone does not have voice dialing  key","  the keypad is a decent size   but the power on off key is small and difficult to press  battery life","  in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side mounted volume control    it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone  headphone jack","  one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia   so standard headphones will not work  phone","  one complaint     the screen is too easily scratched    but there are faceplates to replace it i guess      almost there    i got this phone in t mobile  s current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal    i was getting so sick of my old motorola l       but was waiting for the right phone to come along    this is almost it but not quite but the price was right    that said this phone does what it does extremely well   way better than anything motorola can produce  battery life","  one more thing   the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible  phone","  the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls   real estate broker software   very well at all    i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t mobile   hot spots    browsing","  i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing    i do n t really like bounce    i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones  battery life","  my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons    nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad   which imho is totally unnecessary  key","  this model does have the traditional key arrangement   it  s just that they are really close to one another   and have unconventional shapes   so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands      to be fair   the same can be said about many korean imports   and the nokia  s build quality is light years ahead of the koreans    phone","  finally   i reiterate my thumbs down rating for t mobile as a carrier  t mobile","  their network coverage is very sporadic   and the network always seems overloaded   resulting in very unpleasant calling experience    if you can get this phone for cingular or at t   go with the other carriers  ","  unfortunately   the      does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone   but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming  screen"," t zone","  one downside   as of this writing   t mobile has n t updated their t zone system to fully support the         their website does not show it as a compatible phone   and should i try to access the game downloads on t zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported    i have been assured this will be fixed soon    now   for the t mobile service    i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones    if you have a question   they have the answer    and should they not know it   they can find it out pretty quick    every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone  t mobile service","  the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have    one of the things t mobile brags about is the fact that it  s a   worldphone   and can be used in europe   etc   yet they  ve gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone   including italian   german   and dutch  internet","  the internet functions of the phone   wap and gprs   will only work through t mobile  s services   because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network    therefore   if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card   even if you unlock the phone   there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet    after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another   i got fed up and have decided to return the phone    bottom line   if you  re attracted to this phone because of its tri band feature so you can take it abroad   forget it    find another phone   or buy this one in its manufacturer unlocked form  ","  however   the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality    it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier  voice","  when talking the voice is not very clear  phone"]}
