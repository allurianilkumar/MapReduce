the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my

does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash

the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera   but i can use my metz   with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g  and the    ct      for those who have this metz flash   or the   cl     and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g    the metz module you need is the sca      and the connector cord is the sca     c    in order for this to work   you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you    the results are shadow free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software","  what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g  hardware  color","  without any tweaking at all   if the exposure is accurate   the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film   and this is a raw

objects were n t moving   the photos were awesome  camera","  the camera was a marvel    getting the printer to help output them was another tale    overall i think that you need to consider what you wan t to do    for simple point and shoot photography   consider a cheaper digital    you do n t need the extra resolution or the cost    then again a one time use camera may do just as well    if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality   this will be your camera  camera","","  i chose the g  because of its reputation for very high quality   clean images  lag time","  what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f     once i get focus lock   i can then wait until my restless subject   a pet or a child   strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus    now what about the flash problem  flash","  fortunately   the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera   but i can use my metz   with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g  and the    ct      for those who have this metz flash   or the   cl     and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g    the metz module you need is the sca      and the connector cord is the sca     c    in order for this to work   you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you    the results are shadow free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software","  what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g  hardware  color","  without any tweaking at all   if the exposure is accurate   the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film   and this is a raw image  g "," software","  but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image","  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g    in conjunction with my professional flash system     and can easily put up with the cameras limitations   because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits  ","","  this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well    my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life","  battery life   the drawback to most digital cameras   to quote k  reeves    whoa  manual function"," picture quality","  manual functionality is excellent   downloading pictures is quick and a breeze   and the quality is astounding    i did a good month  s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras   and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder"," camera","  not perfect   yes   the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances but the lcd works well enough in those instances     not the cheapest     mp   but the best     mp    if you do n t believe me on that   check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there    or save time and just do it   you wo n t regret it  ","  the service from the supplier was exceptional    the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo","  having used it for more than a month   i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos    recently   i attended a   flyball   competition     an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo","  by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot   i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos    contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode"," manual mode","  the camera is a dream to operate in automode   but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority   shutter priority   and manual modes    in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro focussing option to shoot wonderful close up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder","  i can  t write enough positive things about this great little camera  ","  but canon never fails to amaze    some of the great gains over g    raw format","      the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post processing flexibility  battery life","      battery life is over     hours   compared to about     hours for the g  or the   hours for most nikons  software","      the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing    looks sort of like picasa software   google it if you dont know   in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g   s   but more intuitive  shape","      the shape of this device is a little squarer   without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking    a big plus in my book        the       sec   f      nd filter for highly exposed   or very brightly lit   environments  light auto correction","  the light auto correction is awesome  picture","  you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun

contrast and saturation        a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view    i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera      looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have   er   canonized it a bit   white offset","      perhaps inspired by the canon  s factory white correction settings   which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out     the g  has much sharper white offsets    in english   this means that even straight out of the box   you  ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking        in dim lit environs the g  could easily outperform any other camera   and thankfully g  maintains this rep    personally i believe it even outperforms the g  in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g ","  overall   the g  delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current     megapixel digicams   from a

wan t to do    for simple point and shoot photography   consider a cheaper digital    you do n t need the extra resolution or the cost    then again a one time use camera may do just as well    if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality   this will be your camera  camera","","  i chose the g  because of its reputation for very high quality   clean images  lag time","  what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f     once i get focus lock   i can then wait until my restless subject   a pet or a child   strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus    now what about the flash problem  flash","  fortunately   the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera   but i can use my metz   with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g  and the    ct      for those who have this metz flash   or the   cl     and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g    the metz module you need is the sca      and the connector cord is the sca     c    in order for this to work   you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you    the results are shadow free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software","  what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g  hardware  color","  without any tweaking at all   if the exposure is accurate   the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film   and this is a raw image  g "," software","  but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image","  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g    in conjunction with my professional flash system     and can easily put up with the cameras limitations   because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits  ","","  this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well    my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life","  battery life   the drawback to most digital cameras   to quote k  reeves    whoa  manual function"," picture quality","  manual functionality is excellent   downloading pictures is quick and a breeze   and the quality is astounding    i did a good month  s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras   and

mp   but the best     mp    if you do n t believe me on that   check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there    or save time and just do it   you wo n t

macro focussing option to shoot wonderful close up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder","  i can  t write enough positive things about this great little camera  ","  but canon never fails to amaze    some of the great gains over g    raw format","      the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post processing

bundled for photo capture is mind blowing    looks sort of like picasa software   google it if you dont know   in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g   s   but more intuitive  shape","      the shape of this device is a little squarer   without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking    a big plus in my book        the       sec   f

     looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have   er   canonized it a bit   white offset","      perhaps inspired by the canon  s factory white correction settings   which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out     the g  has much sharper white offsets    in english   this means that even straight out of the box   you  ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking        in dim lit environs the g  could easily outperform any other camera   and thankfully g  maintains this rep    personally i believe it even outperforms the g  in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g ","  overall   the g  delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current     megapixel digicams   from a

wan t to do    for simple point and shoot photography   consider a cheaper digital    you do n t need the extra resolution or the cost    then again a one time use camera may do just as well    if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality   this will be your camera  camera","","  i chose the g  because of its reputation for very high quality   clean images  lag time","  what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f     once i get focus lock   i can then wait until my restless subject   a pet or a child   strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus    now what about the flash problem  flash","  fortunately   the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera   but i can use my metz   with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g  and the    ct      for those who have this metz flash   or the   cl     and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g    the metz module you need is the sca      and the connector cord is the sca     c    in order for this to work   you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you    the results are shadow free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software","  what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g  hardware  color","  without any tweaking at all   if the exposure is accurate   the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film   and this is a raw

you  ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking        in dim lit environs the g  could easily outperform any other camera   and thankfully g  maintains this rep    personally i believe it even outperforms the g  in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g ","  overall   the g  delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current     megapixel digicams   from a

have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks   even in bright light     and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash    as of this writing   technology has not

see the true   raw image that the camera actually produces    i didnt wait to experiment    instead   i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug in  g ","  the adobe camera raw plug in shows once

same thing as a film camera    and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs    they have n t got all the bugs worked out just yet    most of the time   my g  is a well behaved camera

shoot in lots of light and desire high quality   this will be your camera  camera","","  i chose the g  because of its reputation for very high quality   clean images  lag time","  what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f     once i get focus lock   i can then wait until my restless subject   a pet or a child   strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus    now what about the flash problem  flash","  fortunately   the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera   but i can use my metz   with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g  and the    ct      for those who have this metz flash   or the   cl     and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g    the metz module you need is the sca      and the connector cord is the sca     c    in order for this to work   you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you    the results are shadow free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software","  what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g  hardware  color","  without any tweaking at all   if the exposure is accurate   the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film   and this is a raw

have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks   even in bright light     and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash    as of this writing   technology has not

opposed to    software","  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all   but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera    i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information    maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software   youd see the true   raw image that the camera actually produces    i didnt wait to experiment    instead   i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug in  g ","  the adobe camera raw plug in shows once

have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks   even in bright light     and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash    as of this writing   technology has not

software that comes with it for processing raw images   i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the    mbyte cf with a     mbyte cf   which gives me     raw images   as opposed to    software","  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all   but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera    i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information    maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software   youd see the true   raw image that the camera actually produces    i didnt wait to experiment    instead   i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug in  g ","  the adobe camera raw plug in shows once

is not coming back    the dive   the kick   the blow out the candles moments are   to me   the reason for cameras    a   mm film camera captures the moments you want   while these digital cameras   my friends now inform me   all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture    not all the time   but often enough to be a real problem    like i said   when the moment is gone   it is gone    so buy the g     buy it for fun   for lack of processing   because you want to use iphoto   or whatever    but do not assume   as i did   that the g  has the same ability as

set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash

next time i set it at     and used the flash  flash photo"," noise","  well flash photos are never great   and there was still a lot of noise  photo"," flash","  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks   even in bright light     and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash    as of this writing   technology has not

flash on my nikon slr   the internal flash on the g  produces harsh   flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe","  now there is one more complaint i have about the g  and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images   i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the    mbyte cf with a     mbyte cf   which gives me     raw images   as opposed to    software","  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all   but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera    i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information    maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software   youd see the true   raw image that the camera actually produces    i didnt wait to experiment    instead   i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug in  g ","  the adobe camera raw plug in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software","  what the g  raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical    what the photoshop plug in gives you is

would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds  picture","  got way too many blurry pictures    i have returned the g    actually i tried

purchase   none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture    no one told me   but i wanted to tell you    this is not the same thing as a film camera    and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs    they have n t got all the bugs worked out just yet    most of the time   my g  is a well behaved camera

is not coming back    the dive   the kick   the blow out the candles moments are   to me   the reason for cameras    a   mm film camera captures the moments you want   while these digital cameras   my friends now inform me   all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture    not all the time   but often enough to be a real problem    like i said   when the moment is gone   it is gone    so buy the g     buy it for fun   for lack of processing   because you want to use iphoto   or whatever    but do not assume   as i did   that the g  has the same ability as

instruction booklet says that the camera should display   lens   when the cap and the camera are both on   the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself    i  m concerned

a pet or a child   strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus    now what about the flash problem  flash","  fortunately   the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my

 cl     and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g    the metz module you need is the sca      and the connector cord is the sca     c    in order for this to work   you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you    the results are shadow free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software","  what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g  hardware  color","  without any tweaking at all   if the exposure is accurate   the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film   and this is a raw

brilliant and you can twist around too  camera","  the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle   but since i use the lcd most of the time   this is not really much of a bother to me    still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera","  the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial  its very small and hard to turn so you can  t get an accurate adjustment   for those of you who do n t know what a diopter adjustment is   it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight      i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review  ","","","","      the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying  ","

viewfinder but not views through the lcd    menu","  the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens    however   using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera","  b   the lens cover is surely loose   i already accidently finger printed the len a few times   and au lens tigt and cause potential damage    i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever","  the zooming lever is shaky   i hope it does not operate mechanically   otherwise you  ll feel uneasy  ","","","","  i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust    i wanted it to shoot concerts as well    that meant even less light and just as much action    sure   i adjusted the film speed to      grain","  the grain was terrible    next time i set it at     and used the flash  flash photo"," noise","  well flash photos are never great   and there was still a lot of noise  photo"," flash","  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks   even in bright light     and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash    as of this writing   technology has not solved the focus lock lag time problem for point and shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr    at least once youve got focus lock   the shutter release lag time for the g  is about      of a second   which from what ive read   is better than just about anything else available  depth","  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr   the internal flash on the g  produces harsh   flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe","  now there is one more complaint i have about the g  and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images   i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the    mbyte cf with a     mbyte cf   which gives me     raw images   as opposed to    software","  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all   but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera    i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information    maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software   youd see the true   raw image that the camera actually produces    i didnt wait to experiment    instead   i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug in  g ","  the adobe camera raw plug in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software","  what the g  raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical    what the photoshop plug in gives you is reality   and then if you want fantasy   you can use photoshop to create it  image"," lcd","  about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder    this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler    but who cares    i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera","  the g  had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds  picture","  got way too many blurry pictures    i have returned the g    actually i tried two of them   and have my g   ","  the catch with the canon g  camera     and perhaps all of digital cameras   is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots    prior to the purchase   none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture    no one told me   but i wanted to tell you    this is not the same thing as a film camera    and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs    they have n t got all the bugs worked out just yet    most of the time   my g  is a well behaved camera    but once in a while   i run up against it  s major flaw  delay","","","  shoot","  it feels slow to focus   and unbearably slow to shoot    i challenge anyone   who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon   to say it is fast and responsive    and so i must ask   what are cameras for    what task do they perform    cameras capture moments    they stop time    because once the moment is gone   it is not coming back    the dive   the kick   the blow out the candles moments are   to me   the reason for cameras    a   mm film camera captures the moments you want   while these digital cameras   my friends now inform me   all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture    not all the time   but often enough to be a real problem    like i said   when the moment is gone   it is gone    so buy the g     buy it for fun   for lack of processing   because you want to use iphoto   or whatever    but do not assume   as i did   that the g  has the same ability as ","  unfortunately   this digital moment capturing device called the g  sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted  ","      the included lens cap is very loose on the camera    though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display   lens   when the cap and the camera are both on   the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself    i  m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap   i may damage the lens    very cheaply made  body","      the body construction   buttons   casing   etc   are too plastic    the g  was better in this respect  casing","  it had a heavier and more sturdy casing    despite these grieps   i still recommend the camera  ","  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder   but does not detract from the image at all    as i said   this is the last digital camera i  ll buy   and if you are in the market one   my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever    these things may get a lot better in the future   but from what i  ve seen in the last few years   the technology for digital cameras is n t advancing at the pace of pc  s   phones and hard drives  camera"]},

shoot in lots of light and desire high quality   this will be your camera  camera","","  i chose the g  because of its reputation for very high quality   clean images  lag time","  what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f     once i get focus lock   i can then wait until my restless subject   a pet or a child   strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus    now what about the flash problem  flash","  fortunately   the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera   but i can use my metz   with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g  and the    ct      for those who have this metz flash   or the   cl     and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g    the metz module you need is the sca      and the connector cord is the sca     c    in order for this to work   you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you    the results are shadow free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software","  what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g  hardware  color","  without any tweaking at all   if the exposure is accurate   the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film   and this is a raw image  g "," software","  but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image","  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g    in conjunction with my professional flash system     and can easily put up with the cameras limitations   because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits

brilliant and you can twist around too  camera","  the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle   but since i use the lcd most of the time   this is not really much of a bother to me    still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera","  the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial  its very small and hard to turn so you can  t get an accurate adjustment   for those of you who do n t know what a diopter adjustment is   it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight      i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review  ","","","","      the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying  ","

viewfinder but not views through the lcd    menu","  the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens    however   using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera","  b   the lens cover is surely loose   i already accidently finger printed the len a few times   and au lens tigt and cause potential damage    i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever","  the zooming lever is shaky   i hope it does not operate mechanically   otherwise you  ll feel uneasy  ","","","","  i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust    i wanted it to shoot concerts as well    that meant even less light and just as much action    sure   i adjusted the film speed to      grain","  the grain was terrible    next time i set it at     and used the flash  flash photo"," noise","  well flash photos are never great   and there was still a lot of noise  photo"," flash","  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks   even in bright light     and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash    as of this writing   technology has not solved the focus lock lag time problem for point and shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr    at least once youve got focus lock   the shutter release lag time for the g  is about      of a second   which from what ive read   is better than just about anything else available  depth","  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr   the internal flash on the g  produces harsh   flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe","  now there is one more complaint i have about the g  and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images   i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the    mbyte cf with a     mbyte cf   which gives me     raw images   as opposed to    software","  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all   but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera    i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information    maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software   youd see the true   raw image that the camera actually produces    i didnt wait to experiment    instead   i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug in  g ","  the adobe camera raw plug in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software","  what the g  raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical    what the photoshop plug in gives you is reality   and then if you want fantasy   you can use photoshop to create it  image"," lcd","  about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder    this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler    but who cares    i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera","  the g  had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds  picture","  got way too many blurry pictures    i have returned the g    actually i tried two of them   and have my g   ","  the catch with the canon g  camera     and perhaps all of digital cameras   is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots    prior to the purchase   none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture    no one told me   but i wanted to tell you    this is not the same thing as a film camera    and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs    they have n t got all the bugs worked out just yet    most of the time   my g  is a well behaved camera    but once in a while   i run up against it  s major flaw  delay","","","  shoot","  it feels slow to focus   and unbearably slow to shoot    i challenge anyone   who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon   to say it is fast and responsive    and so i must ask   what are cameras for    what task do they perform    cameras capture moments    they stop time    because once the moment is gone   it is not coming back    the dive   the kick   the blow out the candles moments are   to me   the reason for cameras    a   mm film camera captures the moments you want   while these digital cameras   my friends now inform me   all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture    not all the time   but often enough to be a real problem    like i said   when the moment is gone   it is gone    so buy the g     buy it for fun   for lack of processing   because you want to use iphoto   or whatever    but do not assume   as i did   that the g  has the same ability as ","  unfortunately   this digital moment capturing device called the g  sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted  ","      the included lens cap is very loose on the camera    though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display   lens   when the cap and the camera are both on   the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself    i  m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap   i may damage the lens    very cheaply made  body","      the body construction   buttons   casing   etc   are too plastic    the g  was better in this respect  casing","  it had a heavier and more sturdy casing    despite these grieps   i still recommend the camera  ","  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder   but does not detract from the image at all    as i said   this is the last digital camera i  ll buy   and if you are in the market one   my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever    these things may get a lot better in the future   but from what i  ve seen in the last few years   the technology for digital cameras is n t advancing at the pace of pc  s   phones and hard drives  camera"]},

shoot in lots of light and desire high quality   this will be your camera  camera","","  i chose the g  because of its reputation for very high quality   clean images  lag time","  what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f     once i get focus lock   i can then wait until my restless subject   a pet or a child   strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus    now what about the flash problem  flash","  fortunately   the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera   but i can use my metz   with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g  and the    ct      for those who have this metz flash   or the   cl     and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g    the metz module you need is the sca      and the connector cord is the sca     c    in order for this to work   you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you    the results are shadow free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software","  what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g  hardware  color","  without any tweaking at all   if the exposure is accurate   the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film   and this is a raw image  g "," software","  but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image","  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g    in conjunction with my professional flash system     and can easily put up with the cameras limitations   because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits  ","","  this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well    my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life","  battery life   the drawback to most digital cameras   to quote k  reeves    whoa  manual function"," picture quality","  manual functionality is

cap","","  this camera is worth every penny   and i highly recommend it  battery life","  another point of note   the battery life is incredible    i did not have a backup battery   and had no need

a bother to me    still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera","  the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial  its very small and hard to turn so you can  t get an accurate adjustment   for those of you who do n t know what a diopter adjustment is   it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder

viewfinder but not views through the lcd    menu","  the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens    however   using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera","  b   the lens cover is surely loose   i already accidently finger printed the len a few times   and au lens tigt and cause potential damage    i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever","  the zooming lever is shaky   i hope it does not operate mechanically   otherwise you  ll feel uneasy  ","","","","  i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust    i wanted it to shoot concerts as well    that meant even less light and just as much action    sure   i adjusted the film speed to      grain","  the grain was terrible    next time i set it at     and used the flash  flash photo"," noise","  well flash photos are never great   and there was still a lot of noise  photo"," flash","  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks   even in bright light     and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash    as of this writing   technology has not solved the focus lock lag time problem for point and shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr    at least once youve got focus lock   the shutter release lag time for the g  is about      of a second   which from what ive read   is better than just about anything else available  depth","  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr   the internal flash on the g  produces harsh   flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe","  now there is one more complaint i have about the g  and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images   i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the    mbyte cf with a     mbyte cf   which gives me     raw images   as opposed to    software","  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all   but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera    i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information    maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software   youd see the true   raw image that the camera actually produces    i didnt wait to experiment    instead   i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug in  g ","  the adobe camera raw plug in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software","  what the g  raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical    what the photoshop plug in gives you is reality   and then if you want fantasy   you can use photoshop to create it  image"," lcd","  about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder    this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler    but who cares    i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera","  the g  had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds  picture","  got way too many blurry pictures    i have returned the g    actually i tried two of them   and have my g   ","  the catch with the canon g  camera     and perhaps all of digital cameras   is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots    prior to the purchase   none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture    no one told me   but i wanted to tell you    this is not the same thing as a film camera    and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs    they have n t got all the bugs worked out just yet    most of the time   my g  is a well behaved camera    but once in a while   i run up against it  s major flaw  delay","","","  shoot","  it feels slow to focus   and unbearably slow to shoot    i challenge anyone   who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon   to say it is fast and responsive    and so i must ask   what are cameras for    what task do they perform    cameras capture moments    they stop time    because once the moment is gone   it is not coming back    the dive   the kick   the blow out the candles moments are   to me   the reason for cameras    a   mm film camera captures the moments you want   while these digital cameras   my friends now inform me   all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture    not all the time   but often enough to be a real problem    like i said   when the moment is gone   it is gone    so buy the g     buy it for fun   for lack of processing   because you want to use iphoto   or whatever    but do not assume   as i did   that the g  has the same ability as ","  unfortunately   this digital moment capturing device called the g  sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted  ","      the included lens cap is very loose on the camera    though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display   lens   when the cap and the camera are both on   the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself    i  m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap   i may damage the lens    very cheaply made  body","      the body construction   buttons   casing   etc   are too plastic    the g  was better in this respect  casing","  it had a heavier and more sturdy casing    despite these grieps   i still recommend the camera  ","  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder   but does not detract from the image at all    as i said   this is the last digital camera i  ll buy   and if you are in the market one   my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever    these things may get a lot better in the future   but from what i  ve seen in the last few years   the technology for digital cameras is n t advancing at the pace of pc  s   phones and hard drives  camera","  you can see the lens barrel in the view finder  tiff format","    i knew this before hand   and it is not that bad   there is no tiff format    that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw    to save a picture as raw   you have to have the display on   this seems like a waste of battery power  lag","  it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter    trips      again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are      for those of you using a mac in os x  there is no twain utility

shoot in lots of light and desire high quality   this will be your camera  camera","","  i chose the g  because of its reputation for very high quality   clean images  lag time","  what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f     once i get focus lock   i can then wait until my restless subject   a pet or a child   strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus    now what about the flash problem  flash","  fortunately   the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera   but i can use my metz   with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g  and the    ct      for those who have this metz flash   or the   cl     and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g    the metz module you need is the sca      and the connector cord is the sca     c    in order for this to work   you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you    the results are shadow free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software","  what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g  hardware  color","  without any tweaking at all   if the exposure is accurate   the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film   and this is a raw image  g "," software","  but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image","  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g    in conjunction with my professional flash system     and can easily put up with the cameras limitations   because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits  ","","  this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well    my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life","  battery life   the drawback to most digital cameras   to quote k  reeves    whoa  manual function"," picture quality","  manual functionality is

brilliant and you can twist around too  camera","  the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle   but since i use the lcd most of the time   this is not really much of a bother to me    still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera","  the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial  its very small and hard to turn so you can  t get an accurate adjustment   for those of you who do n t know what a diopter adjustment is   it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder

viewfinder but not views through the lcd    menu","  the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens    however   using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera","  b   the lens cover is surely loose   i already accidently finger printed the len a few times   and au lens tigt and cause potential damage    i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever","  the zooming lever is shaky   i hope it does not operate mechanically   otherwise you  ll feel uneasy  ","","","","  i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust    i wanted it to shoot concerts as well    that meant even less light and just as much action    sure   i adjusted the film speed to      grain","  the grain was terrible    next time i set it at     and used the flash  flash photo"," noise","  well flash photos are never great   and there was still a lot of noise  photo"," flash","  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks   even in bright light     and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash    as of this writing   technology has not solved the focus lock lag time problem for point and shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr    at least once youve got focus lock   the shutter release lag time for the g  is about      of a second   which from what ive read   is better than just about anything else available  depth","  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr   the internal flash on the g  produces harsh   flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe","  now there is one more complaint i have about the g  and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images   i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the    mbyte cf with a     mbyte cf   which gives me     raw images   as opposed to    software","  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all   but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera    i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information    maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software   youd see the true   raw image that the camera actually produces    i didnt wait to experiment    instead   i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug in  g ","  the adobe camera raw plug in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software","  what the g  raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical    what the photoshop plug in gives you is reality   and then if you want fantasy   you can use photoshop to create it  image"," lcd","  about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder    this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler    but who cares    i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera","  the g  had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds  picture","  got way too many blurry pictures    i have returned the g    actually i tried two of them   and have my g   ","  the catch with the canon g  camera     and perhaps all of digital cameras   is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots    prior to the purchase   none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture    no one told me   but i wanted to tell you    this is not the same thing as a film camera    and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs    they have n t got all the bugs worked out just yet    most of the time   my g  is a well behaved camera    but once in a while   i run up against it  s major flaw  delay","","","  shoot","  it feels slow to focus   and unbearably slow to shoot    i challenge anyone   who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon   to say it is fast and responsive    and so i must ask   what are cameras for    what task do they perform    cameras capture moments    they stop time    because once the moment is gone   it is not coming back    the dive   the kick   the blow out the candles moments are   to me   the reason for cameras    a   mm film camera captures the moments you want   while these digital cameras   my friends now inform me   all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture    not all the time   but often enough to be a real problem    like i said   when the moment is gone   it is gone    so buy the g     buy it for fun   for lack of processing   because you want to use iphoto   or whatever    but do not assume   as i did   that the g  has the same ability as ","  unfortunately   this digital moment capturing device called the g  sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted  ","      the included lens cap is very loose on the camera    though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display   lens   when the cap and the camera are both on   the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself    i  m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap   i may damage the lens    very cheaply made  body","      the body construction   buttons   casing   etc   are too plastic    the g  was better in this respect  casing","  it had a heavier and more sturdy casing    despite these grieps   i still recommend the camera  ","  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder   but does not detract from the image at all    as i said   this is the last digital camera i  ll buy   and if you are in the market one   my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever    these things may get a lot better in the future   but from what i  ve seen in the last few years   the technology for digital cameras is n t advancing at the pace of pc  s   phones and hard drives  camera","  you can see the lens barrel in the view finder  tiff format","    i knew this before hand   and it is not that bad   there is no tiff format    that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw    to save a picture as raw   you have to have the display on   this seems like a waste of battery power  lag","  it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter    trips      again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are      for those of you using a mac in os x  there is no twain utility

shoot in lots of light and desire high quality   this will be your camera  camera","","  i chose the g  because of its reputation for very high quality   clean images  lag time","  what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f     once i get focus lock   i can then wait until my restless subject   a pet or a child   strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus    now what about the flash problem  flash","  fortunately   the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera   but i can use my metz   with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g  and the    ct      for those who have this metz flash   or the   cl     and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g    the metz module you need is the sca      and the connector cord is the sca     c    in order for this to work   you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you    the results are shadow free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software","  what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g  hardware  color","  without any tweaking at all   if the exposure is accurate   the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film   and this is a raw image  g "," software","  but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image","  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g    in conjunction with my professional flash system     and can easily put up with the cameras limitations   because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits

canon never fails to amaze    some of the great gains over g    raw format","      the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post processing

a bother to me    still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera","  the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial  its very small and hard to turn so you can  t get an accurate adjustment   for those of you who do n t know what a diopter adjustment is   it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder

viewfinder but not views through the lcd    menu","  the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens    however   using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera","  b   the lens cover is surely loose   i already accidently finger printed the len a few times   and au lens tigt and cause potential damage    i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever","  the zooming lever is shaky   i hope it does not operate mechanically   otherwise you  ll feel uneasy  ","","","","  i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust    i wanted it to shoot concerts as well    that meant even less light and just as much action    sure   i adjusted the film speed to      grain","  the grain was terrible    next time i set it at     and used the flash  flash photo"," noise","  well flash photos are never great   and there was still a lot of noise  photo"," flash","  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks   even in bright light     and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash    as of this writing   technology has not solved the focus lock lag time problem for point and shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr    at least once youve got focus lock   the shutter release lag time for the g  is about      of a second   which from what ive read   is better than just about anything else available  depth","  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr   the internal flash on the g  produces harsh   flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe","  now there is one more complaint i have about the g  and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images   i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the    mbyte cf with a     mbyte cf   which gives me     raw images   as opposed to    software","  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all   but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera    i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information    maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software   youd see the true   raw image that the camera actually produces    i didnt wait to experiment    instead   i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug in  g ","  the adobe camera raw plug in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software","  what the g  raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical    what the photoshop plug in gives you is reality   and then if you want fantasy   you can use photoshop to create it  image"," lcd","  about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder    this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler    but who cares    i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera","  the g  had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds  picture","  got way too many blurry pictures    i have returned the g    actually i tried two of them   and have my g   ","  the catch with the canon g  camera     and perhaps all of digital cameras   is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots    prior to the purchase   none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture    no one told me   but i wanted to tell you    this is not the same thing as a film camera    and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs    they have n t got all the bugs worked out just yet    most of the time   my g  is a well behaved camera    but once in a while   i run up against it  s major flaw  delay","","","  shoot","  it feels slow to focus   and unbearably slow to shoot    i challenge anyone   who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon   to say it is fast and responsive    and so i must ask   what are cameras for    what task do they perform    cameras capture moments    they stop time    because once the moment is gone   it is not coming back    the dive   the kick   the blow out the candles moments are   to me   the reason for cameras    a   mm film camera captures the moments you want   while these digital cameras   my friends now inform me   all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture    not all the time   but often enough to be a real problem    like i said   when the moment is gone   it is gone    so buy the g     buy it for fun   for lack of processing   because you want to use iphoto   or whatever    but do not assume   as i did   that the g  has the same ability as ","  unfortunately   this digital moment capturing device called the g  sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted  ","      the included lens cap is very loose on the camera    though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display   lens   when the cap and the camera are both on   the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself    i  m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap   i may damage the lens    very cheaply made  body","      the body construction   buttons   casing   etc   are too plastic    the g  was better in this respect  casing","  it had a heavier and more sturdy casing    despite these grieps   i still recommend the camera  ","  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder   but does not detract from the image at all    as i said   this is the last digital camera i  ll buy   and if you are in the market one   my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever    these things may get a lot better in the future   but from what i  ve seen in the last few years   the technology for digital cameras is n t advancing at the pace of pc  s   phones and hard drives  camera","  you can see the lens barrel in the view finder  tiff format","    i knew this before hand   and it is not that bad   there is no tiff format    that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw    to save a picture as raw   you have to have the display on   this seems like a waste of battery power  lag","  it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter    trips      again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are      for those of you using a mac in os x  there is no twain utility

shoot in lots of light and desire high quality   this will be your camera  camera","","  i chose the g  because of its reputation for very high quality   clean images  lag time","  what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f     once i get focus lock   i can then wait until my restless subject   a pet or a child   strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus    now what about the flash problem  flash","  fortunately   the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera   but i can use my metz   with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g  and the    ct      for those who have this metz flash   or the   cl     and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g    the metz module you need is the sca      and the connector cord is the sca     c    in order for this to work   you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you    the results are shadow free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software","  what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g  hardware  color","  without any tweaking at all   if the exposure is accurate   the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film   and this is a raw

a bother to me    still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera","  the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial  its very small and hard to turn so you can  t get an accurate adjustment   for those of you who do n t know what a diopter adjustment is   it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder

 the lens cover is surely loose   i already accidently finger printed the len a few times   and au lens tigt and cause potential damage    i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming

this camera in the dust    i wanted it to shoot concerts as well    that meant even less light and just as much action    sure   i adjusted the film speed to      grain","  the grain was terrible    next time i set it at     and used the flash  flash photo"," noise","  well flash photos are never great   and there was still a lot of noise  photo"," flash","  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks   even in bright light     and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash    as of this writing   technology has not solved the focus lock lag time problem for point and shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr    at least once youve got focus lock   the shutter release lag time for the g  is about      of a second   which from what ive read   is better than just about anything else available  depth","  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr   the internal flash on the g  produces harsh   flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe","  now there is one more complaint i have about the g  and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images   i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the    mbyte cf with a     mbyte cf   which gives me     raw images   as opposed to    software","  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all   but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera    i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information    maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software   youd see the true   raw image that the camera actually produces    i didnt wait to experiment    instead   i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug in  g ","  the adobe camera raw plug in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software","  what the g  raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical    what the photoshop plug in gives you is reality   and then if you want fantasy   you can use photoshop to create it  image"," lcd","  about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder    this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler    but who cares    i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera","  the g  had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds  picture","  got way too many blurry pictures    i have returned the g    actually i tried two of them   and have my g   ","  the catch with the canon g  camera     and perhaps all of digital cameras   is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots    prior to the purchase   none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture    no one told me   but i wanted to tell you    this is not the same thing as a film camera    and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs    they have n t got all the bugs worked out just yet    most of the time   my g  is a well behaved camera    but once in a while   i run up against it  s major flaw  delay","","","  shoot","  it feels slow to focus   and unbearably slow to shoot    i challenge anyone   who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon   to say it is fast and responsive    and so i must ask   what are cameras for    what task do they perform    cameras capture moments    they stop time    because once the moment is gone   it is not coming back    the dive   the kick   the blow out the candles moments are   to me   the reason for cameras    a   mm film camera captures the moments you want   while these digital cameras   my friends now inform me   all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture    not all the time   but often enough to be a real problem    like i said   when the moment is gone   it is gone    so buy the g     buy it for fun   for lack of processing   because you want to use iphoto   or whatever    but do not assume   as i did   that the g  has the same ability as ","  unfortunately   this digital moment capturing device called the g  sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted  ","      the included lens cap is very loose on the camera    though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display   lens   when the cap and the camera are both on   the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself    i  m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap   i may damage the lens    very cheaply made  body","      the body construction   buttons   casing   etc   are too plastic    the g  was better in this respect  casing","  it had a heavier and more sturdy casing    despite these grieps   i still recommend the camera  ","  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder   but does not detract from the image at all    as i said   this is the last digital camera i  ll buy   and if you are in the market one   my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever    these things may get a lot better in the future   but from what i  ve seen in the last few years   the technology for digital cameras is n t advancing at the pace of pc  s   phones and hard drives  camera","  you can see the lens barrel in the view finder  tiff format","    i knew this before hand   and it is not that bad   there is no tiff format    that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw    to save a picture as raw   you have to have the display on   this seems like a waste of battery power  lag","  it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter    trips      again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are      for those of you using a mac in os x  there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import","  one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful   mb compactflash card   and for most purposes   it is not enough    however   it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras  noise"]},

focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f     once i get focus lock   i can then wait until my restless subject   a pet or a child   strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus    now what about the flash problem  flash","  fortunately   the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera   but i can use my metz   with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g  and the    ct      for those who have this metz flash   or the   cl     and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g    the metz module you need is the sca      and the connector cord is the sca     c    in order for this to work   you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you    the results are shadow free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software","  what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g  hardware  color","  without any tweaking at all   if the exposure is accurate   the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film   and this is a raw

this camera in the dust    i wanted it to shoot concerts as well    that meant even less light and just as much action    sure   i adjusted the film speed to      grain","  the grain was terrible    next time i set it at     and used the flash  flash photo"," noise","  well flash photos are never great   and there was still a lot of noise  photo"," flash","  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks   even in bright light     and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash    as of this writing   technology has not solved the focus lock lag time problem for point and shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr    at least once youve got focus lock   the shutter release lag time for the g  is about      of a second   which from what ive read   is better than just about anything else available  depth","  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr   the internal flash on the g  produces harsh   flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe","  now there is one more complaint i have about the g  and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images   i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the    mbyte cf with a     mbyte cf   which gives me     raw images   as opposed to    software","  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all   but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera    i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information    maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software   youd see the true   raw image that the camera actually produces    i didnt wait to experiment    instead   i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug in  g ","  the adobe camera raw plug in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software","  what the g  raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical    what the photoshop plug in gives you is reality   and then if you want fantasy   you can use photoshop to create it  image"," lcd","  about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder    this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler    but who cares    i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera","  the g  had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds  picture","  got way too many blurry pictures    i have returned the g    actually i tried two of them   and have my g   ","  the catch with the canon g  camera     and perhaps all of digital cameras   is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots    prior to the purchase   none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture    no one told me   but i wanted to tell you    this is not the same thing as a film camera    and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs    they have n t got all the bugs worked out just yet    most of the time   my g  is a well behaved camera

is not coming back    the dive   the kick   the blow out the candles moments are   to me   the reason for cameras    a   mm film camera captures the moments you want   while these digital cameras   my friends now inform me   all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture    not all the time   but often enough to be a real problem    like i said   when the moment is gone   it is gone    so buy the g     buy it for fun   for lack of processing   because you want to use iphoto   or whatever    but do not assume   as i did   that the g  has the same ability as

instruction booklet says that the camera should display   lens   when the cap and the camera are both on   the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself    i  m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap   i may damage the lens    very cheaply made  body","      the body construction   buttons   casing   etc   are too plastic    the g  was better in this respect  casing","  it had a heavier and more sturdy casing    despite these grieps   i still recommend the camera  ","  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder   but does not detract from the image at all    as i said   this is the last digital camera i  ll buy   and if you are in the market one   my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever    these things may get a lot better in the future   but from what i  ve seen in the last few years   the technology for digital cameras is n t advancing at the pace of pc  s   phones and hard drives  camera","  you can see the lens barrel in the view finder  tiff format","    i knew this before hand   and it is not that bad   there is no tiff format    that would be a nice compromise

the dial you can select shutter priority   for high speed subjects     aperture priority   for focal length   or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode","  the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options    it does n t do you any good if a camera has all the

they have some sample images   taken by this camera   for you to download    if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera   this is probably not what you are looking for    if you are

objects were n t moving   the photos were awesome  camera","  the camera was a marvel    getting the printer to help output them was another tale    overall i think that you need to consider what you wan t to do    for simple point and shoot photography   consider a cheaper digital    you do n t need the extra resolution or the cost    then again a one time use camera may do just as well    if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality   this will be your camera  camera","","  i chose the g  because of its reputation for very high quality   clean images  lag time","  what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f     once i get focus lock   i can then wait until my restless subject   a pet or a child   strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus    now what about the flash problem  flash","  fortunately   the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera   but i can use my metz   with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g  and the    ct      for those who have this metz flash   or the   cl     and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g    the metz module you need is the sca      and the connector cord is the sca     c    in order for this to work   you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you    the results are shadow free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software","  what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g  hardware  color","  without any tweaking at all   if the exposure is accurate   the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film   and this is a raw

have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks   even in bright light     and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash    as of this writing   technology has not

flash on my nikon slr   the internal flash on the g  produces harsh   flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe","  now there is one more complaint i have about the g  and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images   i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the    mbyte cf with a     mbyte cf   which gives me     raw images   as opposed to    software","  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all   but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera    i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information    maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software   youd see the true   raw image that the camera actually produces    i didnt wait to experiment    instead   i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug in  g ","  the adobe camera raw plug in shows once

the viewfinder    this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler    but who cares    i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera","  the g  had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds  picture","  got way too many blurry pictures    i have returned the g    actually i tried two of them   and have my g   ","  the catch with the canon g  camera     and perhaps all of digital cameras   is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots    prior to the purchase   none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture    no one told me   but i wanted to tell you    this is not the same thing as a film camera    and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs    they have n t got all the bugs worked out just yet    most of the time   my g  is a well behaved camera

is not coming back    the dive   the kick   the blow out the candles moments are   to me   the reason for cameras    a   mm film camera captures the moments you want   while these digital cameras   my friends now inform me   all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture    not all the time   but often enough to be a real problem    like i said   when the moment is gone   it is gone    so buy the g     buy it for fun   for lack of processing   because you want to use iphoto   or whatever    but do not assume   as i did   that the g  has the same ability as

instruction booklet says that the camera should display   lens   when the cap and the camera are both on   the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself    i  m concerned

considering the olympus camedia c      but was convinced to buy the g  after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out    the olympus is a bit clumsy looking and the user interface not as friendly as the canon   but one of the features that sold me on the g  was the battery life   no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g     i would recommend a larger compact flash card   at least     mb    i bought a     mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon  ","  this camera has canon  s great colorimetry   plus what you see in the lcd is

they have some sample images   taken by this camera   for you to download    if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera   this is probably not what you are looking for    if you are

objects were n t moving   the photos were awesome  camera","  the camera was a marvel    getting the printer to help output them was another tale    overall i think that you need to consider what you wan t to do    for simple point and shoot photography   consider a cheaper digital    you do n t need the extra resolution or the cost    then again a one time use camera may do just as well    if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality   this will be your camera  camera","","  i chose the g  because of its reputation for very high quality   clean images  lag time","  what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f     once i get focus lock   i can then wait until my restless subject   a pet or a child   strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus    now what about the flash problem  flash","  fortunately   the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera   but i can use my metz   with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g  and the    ct      for those who have this metz flash   or the   cl     and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g    the metz module you need is the sca      and the connector cord is the sca     c    in order for this to work   you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you    the results are shadow free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software","  what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g  hardware  color","  without any tweaking at all   if the exposure is accurate   the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film   and this is a raw image  g "," software","  but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image","  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g    in conjunction with my professional flash system     and can easily put up with the cameras limitations   because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits

getting the settings ready to shoot   i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos    contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode"," manual mode","  the camera is a dream to operate in automode   but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority   shutter priority   and manual modes    in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro focussing option to shoot wonderful close up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder","  i can  t write enough positive things about this great little camera  ","  but canon never fails to amaze    some of the great gains over g    raw format","      the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post processing

and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out     the g  has much sharper white offsets    in english   this means that even straight out of the box   you  ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking        in dim lit environs the g  could easily outperform any other camera   and thankfully g  maintains this rep    personally i believe it even outperforms the g  in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g ","  overall   the g  delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current     megapixel digicams   from a

have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks   even in bright light     and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash    as of this writing   technology has not

software that comes with it for processing raw images   i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the    mbyte cf with a     mbyte cf   which gives me     raw images   as

see the true   raw image that the camera actually produces    i didnt wait to experiment    instead   i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug in  g ","  the adobe camera raw plug in shows once

is gone   it is gone    so buy the g     buy it for fun   for lack of processing   because you want to use iphoto   or whatever    but do not assume   as i did   that the g  has the same ability as ","  unfortunately   this digital moment capturing device called the g  sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted  ","      the included lens cap is very loose on the camera    though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display   lens   when the cap and the camera are both on   the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself    i  m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap   i may damage the lens    very cheaply made  body","      the body construction   buttons   casing   etc   are too plastic    the g  was better in this respect  casing","  it had a heavier and more sturdy casing    despite these grieps   i still recommend the camera  ","  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder   but does not detract from the image at all    as i said   this is the last digital camera i  ll buy   and if you are in the market one   my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever    these things may get a lot better in the future   but from what i  ve seen in the last few years   the technology for digital cameras is n t advancing at the pace of pc  s   phones and hard drives  camera","  you can see the lens barrel in the view finder  tiff format","    i knew this before hand   and it is not that bad   there is no tiff format    that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw    to save a picture as raw   you have to have the display on   this seems like a waste of battery power  lag","  it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter    trips      again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are      for those of you using a mac in os x  there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import","  one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful   mb compactflash card   and for most purposes   it is not enough    however   it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras  noise","  the included memory card is too small    go out and get a    meg card   it  s worth the expense  made","  it is made of plastic    for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped   picking up a camera like the g  is an unnerving experience    this is by no means unique to this model   i  m sure  lens","  the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot    this is not a handbag camera  size","","  the function lever   the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile  flash","  flash   as with all built in flashes in small cameras   you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost    the g  has a shoe which will take other powerful   and expensive   canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography  strap","  the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to    if you can afford this camera   you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere   a very minor quibble    good points  camera"]},

considering the olympus camedia c      but was convinced to buy the g  after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out    the olympus is a bit clumsy looking and the user interface not as friendly as the canon   but one of the features that sold me on the g  was the battery life   no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g     i would recommend a larger compact flash card   at least     mb    i bought a     mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon  ","  this camera has canon  s great colorimetry   plus what you see in the lcd is what you get  print","  the prints are beautiful    and you get about     images on a    mb card at highest quality    i tried out some other brands in the stores   and was disappointed by the battery

are proprietary   they last a really long time   recharge fairly quickly in the camera   plus if you want   more power     you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon

they have some sample images   taken by this camera   for you to download    if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera   this is probably not what you are looking for    if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex   this is it  product","","","  just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has  photo","  takes

objects were n t moving   the photos were awesome  camera","  the camera was a marvel    getting the printer to help output them was another tale    overall i think that you need to consider what you wan t to do    for simple point and shoot photography   consider a cheaper digital    you do n t need the extra resolution or the cost    then again a one time use camera may do just as well    if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality   this will be your camera  camera","","  i chose the g  because of its reputation for very high quality   clean images  lag time","  what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f     once i get focus lock   i can then wait until my restless subject   a pet or a child   strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus    now what about the flash problem  flash","  fortunately   the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera   but i can use my metz   with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g  and the    ct      for those who have this metz flash   or the   cl     and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g    the metz module you need is the sca      and the connector cord is the sca     c    in order for this to work   you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you    the results are shadow free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software","  what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g  hardware  color","  without any tweaking at all   if the exposure is accurate   the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film   and this is a raw image  g "," software","  but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image","  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g    in conjunction with my professional flash system     and can easily put up with the cameras limitations   because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits  ","","  this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well    my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life","  battery life   the drawback to most digital cameras   to quote k  reeves    whoa  manual function"," picture quality","  manual functionality is excellent   downloading pictures is quick and a breeze   and the quality is astounding    i did a good month  s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras   and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder"," camera","  not perfect   yes   the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances but the lcd works well enough in those instances     not the cheapest     mp   but the best     mp    if you do n t believe me on that   check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there    or save time and just do it   you wo n t regret it  ","  the service from the supplier was exceptional    the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo","  having used it for more than a month   i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos    recently   i attended a   flyball   competition     an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo","  by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot   i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos    contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode"," manual mode","  the camera is a dream to operate in automode   but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority   shutter priority   and manual modes    in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro focussing option to shoot wonderful close up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder","  i can  t write enough positive things about this great little camera  ","  but canon never fails to amaze    some of the great gains over g    raw format","      the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post processing flexibility  battery life","      battery life is over     hours   compared to about     hours for the g  or the   hours for most nikons  software","      the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing    looks sort of like picasa software   google it if you dont know   in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g   s   but more intuitive  shape","      the shape of this device is a little squarer   without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking    a big plus in my book        the       sec   f

     looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have   er   canonized it a bit   white offset","      perhaps inspired by the canon  s factory white correction settings   which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out     the g  has much sharper white offsets    in english   this means that even straight out of the box   you  ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking        in dim lit environs the g  could easily outperform any other camera   and thankfully g  maintains this rep    personally i believe it even outperforms the g  in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g ","  overall   the g  delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current     megapixel digicams   from a

and playing with it first  ","  this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used    it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box  macro","  auto mode","  the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot  ","  this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is     megapixel    beats that sony f      its archrival   mp resolution","  i  m glad canon decided to keep the  mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology    i can  t fit all that resolution    mp       x

of the shots taken   this camera is insanely great  picture"," learning curve","  the pictures are fabulous and their is a   short   learning curve to it   there are tons of features i have n t even gotten to    in terms of the important accessories   i got myself an the extra litium battery    based on my used     full charge was enough for at least     shots    i also got myself a    mb viking compact flash   enough for     shots at full  mp resolution and max picture quality   and a used        lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i  ve taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash    the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions   camera and cf   bending   can lead to cf erros   or losing it    anyways   canon has improved upon the g  with this g     it  s a winner  picture quality","  i  ve been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow   car   boat and wind    my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens   the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes   and i  m getting the those      mm adapter and uv lens filter   at lensmateonline com    they got the best lens adapter for the g  better than canon  s    that  s what i did and hopes this helps  "]
,"negative": ["    main dial is not backlit  viewfinder","    lens visible in optical viewfinder      well thats only for old school die hard optical viewfinder fans   use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera","  the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle   but since i use the lcd most of the time   this is not really much of a bother to me    still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera","  the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial  its very small and hard to turn so you can  t get an accurate adjustment   for those of you who do n t know what a diopter adjustment is   it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight      i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review  ","","","","      the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying  "," viewfinder","  the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap   it is not very snug and can come off too easily   and the lens itself   it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd    menu","  the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens    however   using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera","  b   the lens cover is surely loose   i already accidently finger printed the len a few times   and au lens tigt and cause potential damage    i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever","  the zooming lever is shaky   i hope it does not operate mechanically   otherwise you  ll feel uneasy  ","","","","  i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust    i wanted it to shoot concerts as well    that meant even less light and just as much action    sure   i adjusted the film speed to      grain","  the grain was terrible    next time i set it at     and used the flash  flash photo"," noise","  well flash photos are never great   and there was still a lot of noise  photo"," flash","  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks   even in bright light     and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash    as of this writing   technology has not solved the focus lock lag time problem for point and shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr    at least once youve got focus lock   the shutter release lag time for the g  is about      of a second   which from what ive read   is better than just about anything else available  depth","  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr   the internal flash on the g  produces harsh   flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe","  now there is one more complaint i have about the g  and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images   i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the    mbyte cf with a     mbyte cf   which gives me     raw images   as opposed to    software","  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all   but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera    i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information    maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software   youd see the true   raw image that the camera actually produces    i didnt wait to experiment    instead   i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug in  g ","  the adobe camera raw plug in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software","  what the g  raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical    what the photoshop plug in gives you is reality   and then if you want fantasy   you can use photoshop to create it  image"," lcd","  about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder    this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler    but who cares    i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera","  the g  had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds  picture","  got way too many blurry pictures    i have returned the g    actually i tried two of them   and have my g   ","  the catch with the canon g  camera     and perhaps all of digital cameras   is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots    prior to the purchase   none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture    no one told me   but i wanted to tell you    this is not the same thing as a film camera    and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs    they have n t got all the bugs worked out just yet    most of the time   my g  is a well behaved camera    but once in a while   i run up against it  s major flaw  delay","","","  shoot","  it feels slow to focus   and unbearably slow to shoot    i challenge anyone   who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon   to say it is fast and responsive    and so i must ask   what are cameras for    what task do they perform    cameras capture moments    they stop time    because once the moment is gone   it is not coming back    the dive   the kick   the blow out the candles moments are   to me   the reason for cameras    a   mm film camera captures the moments you want   while these digital cameras   my friends now inform me   all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture    not all the time   but often enough to be a real problem    like i said   when the moment is gone   it is gone    so buy the g     buy it for fun   for lack of processing   because you want to use iphoto   or whatever    but do not assume   as i did   that the g  has the same ability as ","  unfortunately   this digital moment capturing device called the g  sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted  ","      the included lens cap is very loose on the camera    though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display   lens   when the cap and the camera are both on   the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself    i  m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap   i may damage the lens    very cheaply made  body","      the body construction   buttons   casing   etc   are too plastic    the g  was better in this respect  casing","  it had a heavier and more sturdy casing    despite these grieps   i still recommend the camera  ","  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder   but does not detract from the image at all    as i said   this is the last digital camera i  ll buy   and if you are in the market one   my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever    these things may get a lot better in the future   but from what i  ve seen in the last few years   the technology for digital cameras is n t advancing at the pace of pc  s   phones and hard drives  camera","  you can see the lens barrel in the view finder  tiff format","    i knew this before hand   and it is not that bad   there is no tiff format    that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw    to save a picture as raw   you have to have the display on   this seems like a waste of battery power  lag","  it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter    trips      again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are      for those of you using a mac in os x  there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import","  one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful   mb compactflash card   and for most purposes   it is not enough    however   it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras  noise","  the included memory card is too small    go out and get a    meg card   it  s worth the expense  made","  it is made of plastic    for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped   picking up a camera like the g  is an unnerving experience    this is by no means unique to this model   i  m sure  lens","  the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot    this is not a handbag camera  size","","  the function lever   the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile  flash","  flash   as with all built in flashes in small cameras   you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost    the g  has a shoe which will take other powerful   and expensive   canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography  strap","  the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to    if you can afford this camera   you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere   a very minor quibble    good points  camera",""]},

wan t to do    for simple point and shoot photography   consider a cheaper digital    you do n t need the extra resolution or the cost    then again a one time use camera may do just as well    if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality   this will be your camera  camera","","  i chose the g  because of its reputation for very high quality   clean images  lag time","  what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f     once i get focus lock   i can then wait until my restless subject   a pet or a child   strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus    now what about the flash problem  flash","  fortunately   the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera   but i can use my metz   with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g  and the    ct      for those who have this metz flash   or the   cl     and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g    the metz module you need is the sca      and the connector cord is the sca     c    in order for this to work   you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you    the results are shadow free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software","  what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g  hardware  color","  without any tweaking at all   if the exposure is accurate   the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film   and this is a raw image  g "," software","  but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image","  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g    in conjunction with my professional flash system     and can easily put up with the cameras limitations   because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits  ","","  this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well    my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life","  battery life   the drawback to most digital cameras   to quote k  reeves    whoa  manual function"," picture quality","  manual functionality is excellent   downloading pictures is quick and a breeze   and the quality is astounding    i did a good month  s worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras   and this is the best buy for the buck  viewfinder"," camera","  not perfect   yes   the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances but the lcd works well enough in those instances     not the cheapest     mp   but the best     mp    if you do n t believe me on that   check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there    or save time and just do it   you wo n t regret it  ","  the service from the supplier was exceptional    the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition  photo","  having used it for more than a month   i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos    recently   i attended a   flyball   competition     an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles  photo","  by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot   i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos    contrary to what other reviewers experienced  automode"," manual mode","  the camera is a dream to operate in automode   but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority   shutter priority   and manual modes    in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro focussing option to shoot wonderful close up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom  viewfinder","  i can  t write enough positive things about this great little camera  ","  but canon never fails to amaze    some of the great gains over g    raw format","      the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post processing flexibility  battery life","      battery life is over     hours   compared to about     hours for the g  or the   hours for most nikons  software","      the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing    looks sort of like picasa software   google it if you dont know   in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g   s   but more intuitive  shape","      the shape of this device is a little squarer   without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking    a big plus in my book        the       sec   f

     looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have   er   canonized it a bit   white offset","      perhaps inspired by the canon  s factory white correction settings   which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out     the g  has much sharper white offsets    in english   this means that even straight out of the box   you  ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking        in dim lit environs the g  could easily outperform any other camera   and thankfully g  maintains this rep    personally i believe it even

on this camera  camera","  i  ve only had it a week   but so far   everything about this camera is making me happy    forget the fact that it  ll probably take me a year to figure out all the features

on to canon  s website    i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this    for those of you who already bought this camera   i suggest you buy a hi ti dye sub photo

gotten to    in terms of the important accessories   i got myself an the extra litium battery    based on my used     full charge was enough for at least     shots    i also got myself a    mb viking

brilliant and you can twist around too  camera","  the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle   but since i use the lcd most of the time   this is not really much of a bother to me    still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera","  the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial  its very small and hard to turn so you can  t get an accurate adjustment   for those of you who do n t know what a diopter adjustment is   it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight      i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review  ","","","","      the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying  "," viewfinder","  the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap   it is not very snug and can come off too easily   and the lens itself   it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd    menu","  the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens    however   using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera","  b   the lens cover is surely loose   i already accidently finger printed the len a few times   and au lens tigt and cause potential damage    i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever","  the zooming lever is shaky   i hope it does not operate mechanically   otherwise you  ll feel uneasy  ","","","","  i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust    i wanted it to shoot concerts as well    that meant even less light and just as much action    sure   i adjusted the film speed to      grain","  the grain was terrible    next time i set it at     and used the flash  flash photo"," noise","  well flash photos are never great   and there was still a lot of noise  photo"," flash","  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks   even in bright light     and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash    as of this writing   technology has not solved the focus lock lag time problem for point and shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr    at least once youve got focus lock   the shutter release lag time for the g  is about      of a second   which from what ive read   is better than just about anything else available  depth","  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr   the internal flash on the g  produces harsh   flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe","  now there is one more complaint i have about the g  and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images   i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the    mbyte cf with a     mbyte cf   which gives me     raw images   as opposed to    software","  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all   but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera    i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information    maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software   youd see the true   raw image that the camera actually produces    i didnt wait to experiment    instead   i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug in  g ","  the adobe camera raw plug in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software","  what the g  raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical    what the photoshop plug in gives you is reality   and then if you want fantasy   you can use photoshop to create it  image"," lcd","  about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder    this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler    but who cares    i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera","  the g  had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds  picture","  got way too many blurry pictures    i have returned the g    actually i tried two of them   and have my g   ","  the catch with the canon g  camera     and perhaps all of digital cameras   is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots    prior to the purchase   none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture    no one told me   but i wanted to tell you    this is not the same thing as a film camera    and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs    they have n t got all the bugs worked out just yet    most of the time   my g  is a well behaved camera    but once in a while   i run up against it  s major flaw  delay","","","  shoot","  it feels slow to focus   and unbearably slow to shoot    i challenge anyone   who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon   to say it is fast and responsive    and so i must ask   what are cameras for    what task do they perform    cameras capture moments    they stop time    because once the moment is gone   it is not coming back    the dive   the kick   the blow out the candles moments are   to me   the reason for cameras    a   mm film camera captures the moments you want   while these digital cameras   my friends now inform me   all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture    not all the time   but often enough to be a real problem    like i said   when the moment is gone   it is gone    so buy the g     buy it for fun   for lack of processing   because you want to use iphoto   or whatever    but do not assume   as i did   that the g  has the same ability as ","  unfortunately   this digital moment capturing device called the g  sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted  ","      the included lens cap is very loose on the camera    though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display   lens   when the cap and the camera are both on   the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself    i  m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap   i may damage the lens    very cheaply made  body","      the body construction   buttons   casing   etc   are too plastic    the g  was better in this respect  casing","  it had a heavier and more sturdy casing    despite these grieps   i still recommend the camera  ","  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder   but does not detract from the image at all    as i said   this is the last digital camera i  ll buy   and if you are in the market one   my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever    these things may get a lot better in the future   but from what i  ve seen in the last few years   the technology for digital cameras is n t advancing at the pace of pc  s   phones and hard drives  camera","  you can see the lens barrel in the view finder  tiff format","    i knew this before hand   and it is not that bad   there is no tiff format    that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw    to save a picture as raw   you have to have the display on   this seems like a waste of battery power  lag","  it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter    trips      again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are      for those of you using a mac in os x  there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import","  one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful   mb compactflash card   and for most purposes   it is not enough    however   it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras  noise","  the included memory card is too small    go out and get a    meg card   it  s worth the expense  made","  it is made of plastic    for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped   picking up a camera like the g  is an unnerving experience    this is by no means unique to this model   i  m sure  lens","  the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot    this is not a handbag camera  size","","  the function lever   the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile  flash","  flash   as with all built in flashes in small cameras   you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost    the g  has a shoe which will take other powerful   and expensive   canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography  strap","  the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to    if you can afford this camera   you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere   a very minor quibble    good points  camera","","  to address two previous somewhat negative reviews         yes   the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder   however   the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder          there are   actually   several differences between the g  and g    such as differences in continuous shooting   the optical lens   the control layout   playback zoom   image processing   and so on

they have some sample images   taken by this camera   for you to download    if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera   this is probably not what you are looking for    if you are

objects were n t moving   the photos were awesome  camera","  the camera was a marvel    getting the printer to help output them was another tale    overall i think that you need to consider what you wan t to do    for simple point and shoot photography   consider a cheaper digital    you do n t need the extra resolution or the cost    then again a one time use camera may do just as well    if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality   this will be your camera  camera","","  i chose the g  because of its reputation for very high quality   clean images  lag time","  what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f     once i get focus lock   i can then wait until my restless subject   a pet or a child   strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus    now what about the flash problem  flash","  fortunately   the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera   but i can use my metz   with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g  and the    ct      for those who have this metz flash   or the   cl     and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g    the metz module you need is the sca      and the connector cord is the sca     c    in order for this to work   you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you    the results are shadow free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software","  what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g  hardware  color","  without any tweaking at all   if the exposure is accurate   the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film   and this is a raw

have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks   even in bright light     and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash    as of this writing   technology has not

software that comes with it for processing raw images   i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the    mbyte cf with a     mbyte cf   which gives me     raw images   as opposed to    software","  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all   but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera    i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information    maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software   youd see the true   raw image that the camera actually produces    i didnt wait to experiment    instead   i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug in  g ","  the adobe camera raw plug in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software","  what the g  raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical    what the photoshop plug in gives you is

the viewfinder    this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler    but who cares    i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera","  the g  had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds  picture","  got way too many blurry pictures    i have returned the g    actually i tried two of them   and have my g   ","  the catch with the canon g  camera     and perhaps all of digital cameras   is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots    prior to the purchase   none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture    no one told me   but i wanted to tell you    this is not the same thing as a film camera    and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs    they have n t got all the bugs worked out just yet    most of the time   my g  is a well behaved camera

is not coming back    the dive   the kick   the blow out the candles moments are   to me   the reason for cameras    a   mm film camera captures the moments you want   while these digital cameras   my friends now inform me   all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture    not all the time   but often enough to be a real problem    like i said   when the moment is gone   it is gone    so buy the g     buy it for fun   for lack of processing   because you want to use iphoto   or whatever    but do not assume   as i did   that the g  has the same ability as

instruction booklet says that the camera should display   lens   when the cap and the camera are both on   the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself    i  m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap   i may damage the lens    very cheaply made  body","      the body construction   buttons   casing   etc   are too plastic    the g  was better in this respect  casing","  it had a heavier and more sturdy casing    despite these grieps   i still recommend the camera  ","  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder   but does not detract from the image at all    as i said   this is the last digital camera i  ll buy   and if you are in the market one   my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it

those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped   picking up a camera like the g  is an unnerving experience    this is by no means unique to this model   i  m sure  lens","  the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot    this is not a handbag camera  size","","  the function lever   the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile  flash","  flash   as with all built in flashes in small cameras   you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost    the g  has a shoe which will take other powerful   and expensive   canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography  strap","  the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to    if you can afford this camera   you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere   a very minor quibble    good points  camera","","  to address two previous somewhat negative reviews         yes   the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder   however   the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder

considering the olympus camedia c      but was convinced to buy the g  after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out    the olympus is a bit clumsy looking and the user interface not as friendly as the canon   but one of the features that sold me on the g  was the battery life   no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g     i would recommend a larger compact flash card   at least     mb    i bought a     mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon  ","  this camera has canon  s great colorimetry   plus what you see in the lcd is

they have some sample images   taken by this camera   for you to download    if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera   this is probably not what you are looking for    if you are

objects were n t moving   the photos were awesome  camera","  the camera was a marvel    getting the printer to help output them was another tale    overall i think that you need to consider what you wan t to do    for simple point and shoot photography   consider a cheaper digital    you do n t need the extra resolution or the cost    then again a one time use camera may do just as well    if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality   this will be your camera  camera","","  i chose the g  because of its reputation for very high quality   clean images  lag time","  what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f     once i get focus lock   i can then wait until my restless subject   a pet or a child   strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus    now what about the flash problem  flash","  fortunately   the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera   but i can use my metz   with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g  and the    ct      for those who have this metz flash   or the   cl     and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g    the metz module you need is the sca      and the connector cord is the sca     c    in order for this to work   you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you    the results are shadow free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software","  what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g  hardware  color","  without any tweaking at all   if the exposure is accurate   the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film   and this is a raw image  g "," software","  but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image","  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g    in conjunction with my professional flash system     and can easily put up with the cameras limitations   because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits

you  ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking        in dim lit environs the g  could easily outperform any other camera   and thankfully g  maintains this rep    personally i believe it even outperforms the g  in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g ","  overall   the g  delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current     megapixel digicams   from a

this camera in the dust    i wanted it to shoot concerts as well    that meant even less light and just as much action    sure   i adjusted the film speed to      grain","  the grain was terrible    next time i set it at     and used the flash  flash photo"," noise","  well flash photos are never great   and there was still a lot of noise  photo"," flash","  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks   even in bright light     and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash    as of this writing   technology has not solved the focus lock lag time problem for point and shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr    at least once youve got focus lock   the shutter release lag time for the g  is about      of a second   which from what ive read   is better than just about anything else available  depth","  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr   the internal flash on the g  produces harsh   flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe","  now there is one more complaint i have about the g  and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images   i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the    mbyte cf with a     mbyte cf   which gives me     raw images   as opposed to    software","  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all   but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera    i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information    maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software   youd see the true   raw image that the camera actually produces    i didnt wait to experiment    instead   i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug in  g ","  the adobe camera raw plug in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software","  what the g  raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical    what the photoshop plug in gives you is reality   and then if you want fantasy   you can use photoshop to create it  image"," lcd","  about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder    this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler    but who cares    i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera","  the g  had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds  picture","  got way too many blurry pictures    i have returned the g    actually i tried two of them   and have my g   ","  the catch with the canon g  camera     and perhaps all of digital cameras   is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots    prior to the purchase   none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture    no one told me   but i wanted to tell you    this is not the same thing as a film camera    and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs    they have n t got all the bugs worked out just yet    most of the time   my g  is a well behaved camera    but once in a while   i run up against it  s major flaw  delay","","","  shoot","  it feels slow to focus   and unbearably slow to shoot    i challenge anyone   who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon   to say it is fast and responsive    and so i must ask   what are cameras for    what task do they perform    cameras capture moments    they stop time    because once the moment is gone   it is not coming back    the dive   the kick   the blow out the candles moments are   to me   the reason for cameras    a   mm film camera captures the moments you want   while these digital cameras   my friends now inform me   all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture    not all the time   but often enough to be a real problem    like i said   when the moment is gone   it is gone    so buy the g     buy it for fun   for lack of processing   because you want to use iphoto   or whatever    but do not assume   as i did   that the g  has the same ability as ","  unfortunately   this digital moment capturing device called the g  sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted  ","      the included lens cap is very loose on the camera    though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display   lens   when the cap and the camera are both on   the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself    i  m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap   i may damage the lens    very cheaply made  body","      the body construction   buttons   casing   etc   are too plastic    the g  was better in this respect  casing","  it had a heavier and more sturdy casing    despite these grieps   i still recommend the camera  ","  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder   but does not detract from the image at all    as i said   this is the last digital camera i  ll buy   and if you are in the market one   my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever    these things may get a lot better in the future   but from what i  ve seen in the last few years   the technology for digital cameras is n t advancing at the pace of pc  s   phones and hard drives  camera","  you can see the lens barrel in the view finder  tiff format","    i knew this before hand   and it is not that bad   there is no tiff format    that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw    to save a picture as raw   you have to have the display on   this seems like a waste of battery power  lag","  it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter    trips      again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are      for those of you using a mac in os x  there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import","  one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful   mb compactflash card   and for most purposes   it is not enough    however   it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras  noise","  the included memory card is too small    go out and get a    meg card   it  s worth the expense  made","  it is made of plastic    for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped   picking up a camera like the g  is an unnerving experience    this is by no means unique to this model   i  m sure  lens","  the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot    this is not a handbag camera  size","","  the function lever   the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile  flash","  flash   as with all built in flashes in small cameras   you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost    the g  has a shoe which will take other powerful   and expensive   canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography  strap","  the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to    if you can afford this camera   you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere   a very minor quibble    good points  camera","","  to address two previous somewhat negative reviews         yes   the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder   however   the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder          there are   actually   several differences between the g  and g    such as differences in continuous shooting   the optical lens   the control layout   playback zoom   image processing   and so on  ","  this camera has a major design flaw  viewfinder","  when you look through the viewfinder   not the lcd   the bottom left corner of the picture   about        is blocked by the lens    i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera    after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder   they finally admitted   it was a design flaw in the camera  camera"]},

shoot in lots of light and desire high quality   this will be your camera  camera","","  i chose the g  because of its reputation for very high quality   clean images  lag time","  what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f     once i get focus lock   i can then wait until my restless subject   a pet or a child   strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus    now what about the flash problem  flash","  fortunately   the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera   but i can use my metz   with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g  and the    ct      for those who have this metz flash   or the   cl     and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g    the metz module you need is the sca      and the connector cord is the sca     c    in order for this to work   you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you    the results are shadow free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software","  what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g  hardware  color","  without any tweaking at all   if the exposure is accurate   the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film   and this is a raw image  g "," software","  but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image","  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g    in conjunction with my professional flash system     and can easily put up with the cameras limitations   because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits

you  ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking        in dim lit environs the g  could easily outperform any other camera   and thankfully g  maintains this rep    personally i believe it even outperforms the g  in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g ","  overall   the g  delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current     megapixel digicams   from a

camera and just print the good ones   which are not many      get the canon     printer and an ex flash    in short   i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots    i have n t used any of them since i got the g     unless your a professional   now you will need only one camera   this one  ","  however   for a               budget   i think this camera is an excellent choice  design","  feature"," use","","  it has a beautiful design   lots of features   very easy to use   very configurable and customizable   and the battery duration is amazing

does n t   it will yield good results on idiot program   auto mode    my wife   who has never used a camera before   picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n t like what you have created you just delete and try again    the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses    this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g   s large mobile screen helps with this    negative points  memory card","  the functionality on this camera is mind blowing  option","  control","  canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out  learning","  learning how to use it will not take very long  image quality","  the image quality is excellent    messing around with images in photoshop   a supplied software package   and printing them on a good printer   yielded excellent results    unless you are making posters   a g  is more than good enough  function","  range of functions   as indicated above   it has something for everyone   point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography    please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used    a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film    i did extensive research before chosing the g  but there  s nothing like picking one up and playing with it first  ","  this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used    it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box  macro","  auto mode","  the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot  ","  this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is     megapixel    beats that sony f      its archrival   mp resolution","  i  m glad canon decided to keep the  mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology    i can  t fit all that resolution    mp       x

of the shots taken   this camera is insanely great  picture"," learning curve","  the pictures are fabulous and their is a   short   learning curve to it   there are tons of features i have n t even gotten to    in terms of the important accessories   i got myself an the extra litium battery    based on my used     full charge was enough for at least     shots    i also got myself a    mb viking compact flash   enough for     shots at full  mp resolution and max picture quality   and a used        lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i  ve taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash    the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions   camera and cf   bending   can lead to cf erros   or losing it    anyways   canon has improved upon the g  with this g     it  s a winner  picture quality","  i  ve been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow   car   boat and wind    my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens   the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes   and i  m getting the those      mm adapter and uv lens filter   at lensmateonline com    they got the best lens adapter for the g  better than canon  s    that  s what i did and hopes this helps  ","  the camera  s a work of art   science    that  s understood  picture"," feel","","  everything else about the camera is great  camera","  if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder   i highly recommend the camera    however for me   i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much    i  m sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected  ",""," optical zoom","  the larger lens of the g  gives better picture quality in low light   and the   times optical zooms gets you just that much closer  lcd","  the moveable lcd screen is great    you can take pictures with the camera held above your head   way down   or beside you with no problem   allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself  remote","  the tiny   postage stamp sized   remote unit is wonderful   not only does it trigger the shutter   it can also be used to zoom and review pictures    i also purchased a good sturdy tripod   the combination of the new camera   tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor   natural light portraits i never would have attempted before  hot shoe flash","  the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit    i chose the canon speedlite        this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs   the built in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos   red eye   and annoying shadows   a good add on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing   almost natural lighting  battery","  i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s      but the battery in the g  is a real powerhouse    i shot over     photos at my goddaughter  s birthday party without switching out to my backup battery  battery charging system","  the g  has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras   the battery needs to be charged while in the camera   but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery  manual","  i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options   shutter priority   aperature priority   light metering adjustments   etc    but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear    you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting   or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do    negatives  highlight","  i was worried that   megapixel photos would download more slowly   but there  s no difference in working with the files    i have a     gb remote drive i use to store my digital images    i can imagine that they  d fill up my ibook  s internal memory pretty quickly    at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe  s photoshop elments     software   and can  t praise it highly enough    if you  re investing in a camera at this level   buy this software    and as i said in my review of the s      all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers    the bottom line   if you  re serious about your digital photography   or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point and shoot   this may be just the camera for you    but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time   you  ll see the difference in your photos immediately    added       camera","  i  ve now had the camera for two months and i  m even more pleased with it    i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white balance setting    it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures   especially in mixed light settings    if you do n t have a gray card   you can use a plain white piece of paper    i also discovered the exposure bracket setting   which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter   the first at the camera determined exposure   then one lighter and one darker    especially useful with portraits and difficult to meter situations    i did buy the telephoto lens   and the required extension      very easy to use    i  ll probably also get the wide angle now   too  camera","

brilliant and you can twist around too  camera","  the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle   but since i use the lcd most of the time   this is not really much of a bother to me    still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera","  the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial  its very small and hard to turn so you can  t get an accurate adjustment   for those of you who do n t know what a diopter adjustment is   it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight      i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review  ","","","","      the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying  ","

viewfinder but not views through the lcd    menu","  the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens    however   using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera","  b   the lens cover is surely loose   i already accidently finger printed the len a few times   and au lens tigt and cause potential damage    i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever","  the zooming lever is shaky   i hope it does not operate mechanically   otherwise you  ll feel uneasy  ","","","","  i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust    i wanted it to shoot concerts as well    that meant even less light and just as much action    sure   i adjusted the film speed to      grain","  the grain was terrible    next time i set it at     and used the flash  flash photo"," noise","  well flash photos are never great   and there was still a lot of noise  photo"," flash","  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks   even in bright light     and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash    as of this writing   technology has not solved the focus lock lag time problem for point and shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr    at least once youve got focus lock   the shutter release lag time for the g  is about      of a second   which from what ive read   is better than just about anything else available  depth","  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr   the internal flash on the g  produces harsh   flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe","  now there is one more complaint i have about the g  and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images   i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the    mbyte cf with a     mbyte cf   which gives me     raw images   as opposed to    software","  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all   but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera    i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information    maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software   youd see the true   raw image that the camera actually produces    i didnt wait to experiment    instead   i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug in  g ","  the adobe camera raw plug in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software","  what the g  raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical    what the photoshop plug in gives you is reality   and then if you want fantasy   you can use photoshop to create it  image"," lcd","  about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder    this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler    but who cares    i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera","  the g  had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds  picture","  got way too many blurry pictures    i have returned the g    actually i tried two of them   and have my g   ","  the catch with the canon g  camera     and perhaps all of digital cameras   is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots    prior to the purchase   none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture    no one told me   but i wanted to tell you    this is not the same thing as a film camera    and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs    they have n t got all the bugs worked out just yet    most of the time   my g  is a well behaved camera    but once in a while   i run up against it  s major flaw  delay","","","  shoot","  it feels slow to focus   and unbearably slow to shoot    i challenge anyone   who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon   to say it is fast and responsive    and so i must ask   what are cameras for    what task do they perform    cameras capture moments    they stop time    because once the moment is gone   it is not coming back    the dive   the kick   the blow out the candles moments are   to me   the reason for cameras    a   mm film camera captures the moments you want   while these digital cameras   my friends now inform me   all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture    not all the time   but often enough to be a real problem    like i said   when the moment is gone   it is gone    so buy the g     buy it for fun   for lack of processing   because you want to use iphoto   or whatever    but do not assume   as i did   that the g  has the same ability as ","  unfortunately   this digital moment capturing device called the g  sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted  ","      the included lens cap is very loose on the camera    though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display   lens   when the cap and the camera are both on   the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself    i  m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap   i may damage the lens    very cheaply made  body","      the body construction   buttons   casing   etc   are too plastic    the g  was better in this respect  casing","  it had a heavier and more sturdy casing    despite these grieps   i still recommend the camera  ","  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder   but does not detract from the image at all    as i said   this is the last digital camera i  ll buy   and if you are in the market one   my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever    these things may get a lot better in the future   but from what i  ve seen in the last few years   the technology for digital cameras is n t advancing at the pace of pc  s   phones and hard drives  camera","  you can see the lens barrel in the view finder  tiff format","    i knew this before hand   and it is not that bad   there is no tiff format    that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw    to save a picture as raw   you have to have the display on   this seems like a waste of battery power  lag","  it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter    trips      again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are      for those of you using a mac in os x  there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import","  one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful   mb compactflash card   and for most purposes   it is not enough    however   it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras  noise","  the included memory card is too small    go out and get a    meg card   it  s worth the expense  made","  it is made of plastic    for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped   picking up a camera like the g  is an unnerving experience    this is by no means unique to this model   i  m sure  lens","  the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot    this is not a handbag camera  size","","  the function lever   the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile  flash","  flash   as with all built in flashes in small cameras   you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost    the g  has a shoe which will take other powerful   and expensive   canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography  strap","  the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to    if you can afford this camera   you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere   a very minor quibble    good points  camera","","  to address two previous somewhat negative reviews         yes   the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder   however   the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder          there are   actually   several differences between the g  and g    such as differences in continuous shooting   the optical lens   the control layout   playback zoom   image processing   and so on  ","  this camera has a major design flaw  viewfinder","  when you look through the viewfinder   not the lcd   the bottom left corner of the picture   about        is blocked by the lens    i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera    after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder   they finally admitted   it was a design flaw in the camera  camera","  i  ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s      and the g  seems to do only slightly better      i  m starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level    no off button","  the on off button feels somewhat flimsy   and has an awkward   tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera  body","  and the body   construction in general has quite a bit of plastic   a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s       i bought a     mb card   which seems to

hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos  control","  i love having the option to manually control the f stop   shutter speed and even focus  photo","  i was able to take great photos of the  th of july fire works   and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers    warning   i did read the manual  control","  but if you  ve used a slr   mm camera   the controls are very intuitive    once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located  dial","  with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority   for high speed subjects     aperture priority   for focal length   or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality  manual mode","  the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options    it does n t do you any good if a camera has all the

they have some sample images   taken by this camera   for you to download    if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera   this is probably not what you are looking for    if you are

objects were n t moving   the photos were awesome  camera","  the camera was a marvel    getting the printer to help output them was another tale    overall i think that you need to consider what you wan t to do    for simple point and shoot photography   consider a cheaper digital    you do n t need the extra resolution or the cost    then again a one time use camera may do just as well    if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality   this will be your camera  camera","","  i chose the g  because of its reputation for very high quality   clean images  lag time","  what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f     once i get focus lock   i can then wait until my restless subject   a pet or a child   strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus    now what about the flash problem  flash","  fortunately   the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera   but i can use my metz   with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g  and the    ct      for those who have this metz flash   or the   cl     and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g    the metz module you need is the sca      and the connector cord is the sca     c    in order for this to work   you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you    the results are shadow free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software","  what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g  hardware  color","  without any tweaking at all   if the exposure is accurate   the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film   and this is a raw image  g "," software","  but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image","  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am

flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit    i chose the canon speedlite        this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs   the built in flash

this camera i also bought adobe  s photoshop elments     software   and can  t praise it highly enough    if you  re investing in a camera at this level   buy this software    and as i said in my review of the s      all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers    the bottom line   if you  re serious about your digital photography   or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point and shoot   this may be just the camera for you    but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time   you  ll see the difference in your photos immediately    added       camera","  i  ve now had the camera for two months and i  m even more pleased with it    i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white balance setting    it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures   especially in mixed light settings    if you do n t have a gray card   you can use a plain white piece of paper    i also discovered the exposure bracket setting   which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter   the first at the camera determined exposure   then one lighter and one darker    especially useful with portraits and difficult to meter situations    i did buy the telephoto lens   and the required extension      very easy to use    i  ll probably also get the wide angle now   too  camera","

all that it  s advertised    after doing a hands on comparison between the nikon coolpix      and sony dsc f       both of which lack the quality   feel   or features of the g      i ultimately chose the g  because of its outstanding image quality   resolution and coloration are superior      it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life   enthusiast features   external flash capabilities   available storage types   image formats   and more    this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features    it can be a point and shoot

purchase   none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture    no one told me   but i wanted to tell you    this is not the same thing as a film camera    and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs    they have n t got all the bugs worked out just yet    most of the time   my g  is a well behaved camera    but once in a while   i run up against it  s major flaw  delay","","","  shoot","  it feels slow to focus   and unbearably slow to shoot    i challenge anyone   who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon   to say it is fast and responsive    and so i must ask   what are cameras for    what task do they perform    cameras capture moments    they stop time    because once the moment is gone   it is not coming back    the dive   the kick   the blow out the candles moments are   to me   the reason for cameras    a   mm film camera captures the moments you want   while these digital cameras   my friends now inform me   all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture    not all the time   but often enough to be a real problem    like i said   when the moment is gone   it is gone    so buy the g     buy it for fun   for lack of processing   because you want to use iphoto   or whatever    but do not assume   as i did   that the g  has the same ability as ","  unfortunately   this digital moment capturing device called the g  sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted  ","      the included lens cap is very loose on the camera    though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display   lens   when the cap and the camera are both on   the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself    i  m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap   i may damage the lens    very cheaply made  body","      the body construction   buttons   casing   etc   are too plastic    the g  was better in this respect  casing","  it had a heavier and more sturdy casing    despite these grieps   i still recommend the camera  ","  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder   but does not detract from the image at all    as i said   this is the last digital camera i  ll buy   and if you are in the market one   my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever    these things may get a lot better in the future   but from what i  ve seen in the last few years   the technology for digital cameras is n t advancing at the pace of pc  s   phones and hard drives  camera","  you can see the lens barrel in the view finder  tiff format","    i knew this before hand   and it is not that bad   there is no tiff format    that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw    to save a picture as raw   you have to have the display on   this seems like a waste of battery power  lag","  it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter    trips      again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are      for those of you using a mac in os x  there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import","  one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful   mb compactflash card   and for most purposes   it is not enough    however   it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras  noise","  the included memory card is too small    go out and get a    meg card   it  s worth the expense  made","  it is made of plastic    for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped   picking up a camera like the g  is an unnerving experience    this is by no means unique to this model   i  m sure  lens","  the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot    this is not a handbag camera  size","","  the function lever   the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile  flash","  flash   as with all built in flashes in small cameras   you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost    the g  has a shoe which will take other powerful   and expensive   canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography  strap","  the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to    if you can afford this camera   you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere   a very minor quibble    good points  camera","","  to address two previous somewhat negative reviews         yes   the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder   however   the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder          there are   actually   several differences between the g  and g    such as differences in continuous shooting   the optical lens   the control layout   playback zoom   image processing   and so on  ","  this camera has a major design flaw  viewfinder","  when you look through the viewfinder   not the lcd   the bottom left corner of the picture   about        is blocked by the lens    i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera    after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder   they finally admitted   it was a design flaw in the camera  camera","  i  ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s      and the g  seems to do only slightly better      i  m starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level    no off button","  the on off button feels somewhat flimsy   and has an awkward   tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera  body","  and the body   construction in general has quite a bit of plastic   a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s       i bought a     mb card   which seems to hold about     photos at the highest resolution  download"]},

considering the olympus camedia c      but was convinced to buy the g  after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out    the olympus is a bit clumsy looking and the user interface

wan t to do    for simple point and shoot photography   consider a cheaper digital    you do n t need the extra resolution or the cost    then again a one time use camera may do just as well    if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality   this will be your camera  camera","","  i chose the g  because of its reputation for very high quality   clean images  lag time","  what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f     once i get focus lock   i can then wait until my restless subject   a pet or a child   strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus    now what about the flash problem  flash","  fortunately   the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera   but i can use my metz   with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g  and the    ct      for those who have this metz flash   or the   cl     and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g    the metz module you need is the sca      and the connector cord is the sca     c    in order for this to work   you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you    the results are shadow free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software","  what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g  hardware  color","  without any tweaking at all   if the exposure is accurate   the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film   and this is a raw image  g "," software","  but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera  raw image","  i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g    in conjunction with my professional flash system     and can easily put up with the cameras limitations   because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits  ","","  this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well    my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time  battery life","  battery life   the drawback to most digital cameras   to quote k  reeves    whoa  manual function"," picture quality","  manual functionality is

and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out     the g  has much sharper white offsets    in english   this means that even straight out of the box   you  ll be amazed at the pics you end up taking        in dim lit environs the g  could easily outperform any other camera   and thankfully g  maintains this rep    personally i believe it even outperforms the g  in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors  g ","  overall   the g  delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current     megapixel digicams   from a

uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film  camera","  this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you  ll use all the time    my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home   but now she  s forever asking for the digital camera    and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want   let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones   which are not many      get the canon     printer and an ex flash    in short   i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots    i have n t used any of them since i got the g     unless your a professional   now you will need only one camera   this one  ","  however   for a               budget   i think this camera is an excellent choice  design","  feature"," use","","  it has a beautiful design   lots of features   very easy to use   very configurable and customizable   and the battery duration is amazing  display","  also   the display is   hinged   and it can be placed in a myriad of positions   or to protect it against any damage    excellent idea  compactflash","  another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i  ve seen  ","  i have owned this camera for a short time and would n t give it up for anything  camera","  it surpasses my greatest expectations in a  mp camera   ","",""," control","  it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly  feature","  the g  has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi pro   pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography  auto mode","  in the hands of someone who does n t   it will yield good results on idiot program   auto mode    my wife   who has never used a camera before   picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n t like what you have created you just delete and try again    the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses    this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g   s large mobile screen helps with this    negative points  memory card","  the functionality on this camera is mind blowing  option","  control","  canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out  learning","  learning how to use it will not take very long  image quality","  the image quality is excellent    messing around with images in photoshop   a supplied software package   and printing them on a good printer   yielded excellent results    unless you are making posters   a g  is more than good enough  function","  range of functions   as indicated above   it has something for everyone   point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography    please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used    a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film    i did extensive research before chosing the g  but there  s nothing like picking one up and playing with it first  ","  this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used    it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box  macro","  auto mode","  the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot  ","  this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is     megapixel    beats that sony f      its archrival   mp resolution","  i  m glad canon decided to keep the  mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology    i can  t fit all that resolution    mp       x

of the shots taken   this camera is insanely great  picture"," learning curve","  the pictures are fabulous and their is a   short   learning curve to it   there are tons of features i have n t even gotten to    in terms of the important accessories   i got myself an the extra litium battery    based on my used     full charge was enough for at least     shots    i also got myself a    mb viking compact flash   enough for     shots at full  mp resolution and max picture quality   and a used        lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i  ve taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash    the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions   camera and cf   bending   can lead to cf erros   or losing it    anyways   canon has improved upon the g  with this g     it  s a winner  picture quality","  i  ve been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow   car   boat and wind    my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens   the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes   and i  m getting the those      mm adapter and uv lens filter   at lensmateonline com    they got the best lens adapter for the g  better than canon  s    that  s what i did and hopes this helps  ","  the camera  s a work of art   science    that  s understood  picture"," feel","","  everything else about the camera is great  camera","  if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder   i highly recommend the camera    however for me   i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much    i  m sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected  ",""," optical zoom","  the larger lens of the g  gives better picture quality in low light   and the   times optical zooms gets you just that much closer  lcd","  the moveable lcd screen is great    you can take pictures with the camera held above your head   way down   or beside you with no problem   allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself  remote","  the tiny   postage stamp sized   remote unit is wonderful   not only does it trigger the shutter   it can also be used to zoom and review pictures    i also purchased a good sturdy tripod   the combination of the new camera   tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor   natural light portraits i never would have attempted before  hot shoe flash","  the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit    i chose the canon speedlite        this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs   the built in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos   red eye   and annoying shadows   a good add on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing   almost natural lighting  battery","  i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s      but the battery in the g  is a real powerhouse    i shot over     photos at my goddaughter  s birthday party without switching out to my backup battery  battery charging system","  the g  has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras   the battery needs to be charged while in the camera   but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery  manual","  i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options   shutter priority   aperature priority   light metering adjustments   etc    but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear    you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting   or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do    negatives  highlight","  i was worried that   megapixel photos would download more slowly   but there  s no difference in working with the files    i have a     gb remote drive i use to store my digital images    i can imagine that they  d fill up my ibook  s internal memory pretty quickly    at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe  s photoshop elments     software   and can  t praise it highly enough    if you  re investing in a camera at this level   buy this software    and as i said in my review of the s      all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers    the bottom line   if you  re serious about your digital photography   or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point and shoot   this may be just the camera for you    but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time   you  ll see the difference in your photos immediately    added       camera","  i  ve now had the camera for two months and i  m even more pleased with it    i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white balance setting    it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures   especially in mixed light settings    if you do n t have a gray card   you can use a plain white piece of paper    i also discovered the exposure bracket setting   which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter   the first at the camera determined exposure   then one lighter and one darker    especially useful with portraits and difficult to meter situations    i did buy the telephoto lens   and the required extension      very easy to use    i  ll probably also get the wide angle now   too  camera"," use"," photo","  very comfortable camera   easy to use   and the best digital photos you  re going to get at this price  ","  i  ve been using the g  for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it  s advertised    after doing a hands on comparison between the nikon coolpix      and sony dsc f       both of which lack the quality   feel   or features of the g      i ultimately chose the g  because of its outstanding image quality   resolution and coloration are superior      it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life   enthusiast features   external flash capabilities   available storage types   image formats   and more    this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features    it can be a point and shoot camera   but if you do not intend to   get into   it  s finer features   i  d suggest a less enthusiast featured choice  camera","  all in all   i believe this is arguably the best non slr digital camera on the market  ","  canon  s optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better  digital camera","  simply   the canon g  is the best digital camera out there today at this price point    the canon allows you to change lenses   and it accepts the ibm microdrive   type ii compact flash     so you can have up to   gigabyte of storage    for me on the fine resolution setting   not maximum but very close   this adds up to over      images with the   gig card  battery life","  the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon      and is better than anything else i  ve seen  look","  even with these shortcomings   i still think it is the best digital camera available under         "]
,"negative": ["    main dial is not backlit  viewfinder","    lens visible in optical viewfinder      well thats only for old school die hard optical viewfinder fans   use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too  camera","  the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle   but since i use the lcd most of the time   this is not really much of a bother to me    still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera  camera","  the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial  its very small and hard to turn so you can  t get an accurate adjustment   for those of you who do n t know what a diopter adjustment is   it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight      i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review  ","","","","      the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying  ","

viewfinder but not views through the lcd    menu","  the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens    however   using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem  camera","  b   the lens cover is surely loose   i already accidently finger printed the len a few times   and au lens tigt and cause potential damage    i wish canon would work out some way for that issue  zooming lever","  the zooming lever is shaky   i hope it does not operate mechanically   otherwise you  ll feel uneasy  ","","","","  i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust    i wanted it to shoot concerts as well    that meant even less light and just as much action    sure   i adjusted the film speed to      grain","  the grain was terrible    next time i set it at     and used the flash  flash photo"," noise","  well flash photos are never great   and there was still a lot of noise  photo"," flash","  the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus locks   even in bright light     and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built in flash    as of this writing   technology has not solved the focus lock lag time problem for point and shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr    at least once youve got focus lock   the shutter release lag time for the g  is about      of a second   which from what ive read   is better than just about anything else available  depth","  relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr   the internal flash on the g  produces harsh   flat images with ugly hot spots  external flash hot shoe","  now there is one more complaint i have about the g  and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images   i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the    mbyte cf with a     mbyte cf   which gives me     raw images   as opposed to    software","  the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all   but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera    i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information    maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software   youd see the true   raw image that the camera actually produces    i didnt wait to experiment    instead   i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug in  g ","  the adobe camera raw plug in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software  software","  what the g  raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical    what the photoshop plug in gives you is reality   and then if you want fantasy   you can use photoshop to create it  image"," lcd","  about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder    this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler    but who cares    i always shoot using the lcd panel  camera","  the g  had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds  picture","  got way too many blurry pictures    i have returned the g    actually i tried two of them   and have my g   ","  the catch with the canon g  camera     and perhaps all of digital cameras   is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots    prior to the purchase   none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture    no one told me   but i wanted to tell you    this is not the same thing as a film camera    and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs    they have n t got all the bugs worked out just yet    most of the time   my g  is a well behaved camera    but once in a while   i run up against it  s major flaw  delay","","","  shoot","  it feels slow to focus   and unbearably slow to shoot    i challenge anyone   who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon   to say it is fast and responsive    and so i must ask   what are cameras for    what task do they perform    cameras capture moments    they stop time    because once the moment is gone   it is not coming back    the dive   the kick   the blow out the candles moments are   to me   the reason for cameras    a   mm film camera captures the moments you want   while these digital cameras   my friends now inform me   all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture    not all the time   but often enough to be a real problem    like i said   when the moment is gone   it is gone    so buy the g     buy it for fun   for lack of processing   because you want to use iphoto   or whatever    but do not assume   as i did   that the g  has the same ability as ","  unfortunately   this digital moment capturing device called the g  sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted  ","      the included lens cap is very loose on the camera    though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display   lens   when the cap and the camera are both on   the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself    i  m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap   i may damage the lens    very cheaply made  body","      the body construction   buttons   casing   etc   are too plastic    the g  was better in this respect  casing","  it had a heavier and more sturdy casing    despite these grieps   i still recommend the camera  ","  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder   but does not detract from the image at all    as i said   this is the last digital camera i  ll buy   and if you are in the market one   my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever    these things may get a lot better in the future   but from what i  ve seen in the last few years   the technology for digital cameras is n t advancing at the pace of pc  s   phones and hard drives  camera","  you can see the lens barrel in the view finder  tiff format","    i knew this before hand   and it is not that bad   there is no tiff format    that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw    to save a picture as raw   you have to have the display on   this seems like a waste of battery power  lag","  it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter    trips      again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are      for those of you using a mac in os x  there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import","  one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful   mb compactflash card   and for most purposes   it is not enough    however   it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras  noise","  the included memory card is too small    go out and get a    meg card   it  s worth the expense  made","  it is made of plastic    for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped   picking up a camera like the g  is an unnerving experience    this is by no means unique to this model   i  m sure  lens","  the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot    this is not a handbag camera  size","","  the function lever   the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile  flash","  flash   as with all built in flashes in small cameras   you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost    the g  has a shoe which will take other powerful   and expensive   canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography  strap","  the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to    if you can afford this camera   you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere   a very minor quibble    good points  camera","","  to address two previous somewhat negative reviews         yes   the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder   however   the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder          there are   actually   several differences between the g  and g    such as differences in continuous shooting   the optical lens   the control layout   playback zoom   image processing   and so on  ","  this camera has a major design flaw  viewfinder","  when you look through the viewfinder   not the lcd   the bottom left corner of the picture   about        is blocked by the lens    i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera    after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder   they finally admitted   it was a design flaw in the camera  camera","  i  ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s      and the g  seems to do only slightly better      i  m starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level    no off button","  the on off button feels somewhat flimsy   and has an awkward   tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera  body","  and the body   construction in general has quite a bit of plastic   a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s       i bought a     mb card   which seems to hold about     photos at the highest resolution  download","  the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking   it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap   and it is a bit slow between shots  camera"]},

 the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options    it does n t do you any good if a camera has all the

they have some sample images   taken by this camera   for you to download    if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera   this is probably not what you are looking for    if you are

objects were n t moving   the photos were awesome  camera","  the camera was a marvel    getting the printer to help output them was another tale    overall i think that you need to consider what you wan t to do    for simple point and shoot photography   consider a cheaper digital    you do n t need the extra resolution or the cost    then again a one time use camera may do just as well    if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality   this will be your camera  camera","","  i chose the g  because of its reputation for very high quality   clean images  lag time","  what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f     once i get focus lock   i can then wait until my restless subject   a pet or a child   strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus    now what about the flash problem  flash","  fortunately   the g  has a hot shoe that can take an external flash   and fortunately for me   i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy   the metz    ct      i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera   but i can use my metz   with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g  and the    ct      for those who have this metz flash   or the   cl     and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g    the metz module you need is the sca      and the connector cord is the sca     c    in order for this to work   you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f stop yourself  flash","  contrary to what ive read elsewhere   the g  does sync at       of a second with third party flashes   just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon    you also have to set the g  to second shutter sync   which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow    then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca      control panel   because they are all ignored    the g  completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash   and most of the time   the exposure is spot on and when it isnt   its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself    this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce flashing   or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away    unfortunately   the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available   so the first problem cant easily be solved    the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz   with the attendant shadows unfortunately      but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range   the g  is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f    film camera    the    ct   flash head can actually be reversed     degrees and then tilted   enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you    the results are shadow free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine  software","  what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g  hardware  color","  without any tweaking at all   if the exposure is accurate   the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film   and this is a raw

this camera i also bought adobe  s photoshop elments     software   and can  t praise it highly enough    if you  re investing in a camera at this level   buy this software    and as i said in my review of the s      all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers    the bottom line   if you  re serious about your digital photography   or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point and shoot   this may be just the camera for you    but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time   you  ll see the difference in your photos immediately    added       camera","  i  ve now had the camera for two months and i  m even more pleased with it    i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white balance setting    it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures   especially in mixed light settings    if you do n t have a gray card   you can use a plain white piece of paper    i also discovered the exposure bracket setting   which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter   the first at the camera determined exposure   then one lighter and one darker    especially useful with portraits and difficult to meter situations    i did buy the telephoto lens   and the required extension      very easy to use    i  ll probably also get the wide angle now   too  camera","

two of them   and have my g   ","  the catch with the canon g  camera     and perhaps all of digital cameras   is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots    prior to the purchase   none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture    no one told me   but i wanted to tell you    this is not the same thing as a film camera    and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs    they have n t got all the bugs worked out just yet    most of the time   my g  is a well behaved camera    but once in a while   i run up against it  s major flaw  delay","","","  shoot","  it feels slow to focus   and unbearably slow to shoot    i challenge anyone   who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon   to say it is fast and responsive    and so i must ask   what are cameras for    what task do they perform    cameras capture moments    they stop time    because once the moment is gone   it is not coming back    the dive   the kick   the blow out the candles moments are   to me   the reason for cameras    a   mm film camera captures the moments you want   while these digital cameras   my friends now inform me   all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture    not all the time   but often enough to be a real problem    like i said   when the moment is gone   it is gone    so buy the g     buy it for fun   for lack of processing   because you want to use iphoto   or whatever    but do not assume   as i did   that the g  has the same ability as ","  unfortunately   this digital moment capturing device called the g  sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted  ","      the included lens cap is very loose on the camera    though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display   lens   when the cap and the camera are both on   the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself    i  m concerned that with the easily removed lens cap   i may damage the lens    very cheaply made  body","      the body construction   buttons   casing   etc   are too plastic    the g  was better in this respect  casing","  it had a heavier and more sturdy casing    despite these grieps   i still recommend the camera  ","  one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder   but does not detract from the image at all    as i said   this is the last digital camera i  ll buy   and if you are in the market one   my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever    these things may get a lot better in the future   but from what i  ve seen in the last few years   the technology for digital cameras is n t advancing at the pace of pc  s   phones and hard drives  camera","  you can see the lens barrel in the view finder  tiff format","    i knew this before hand   and it is not that bad   there is no tiff format    that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw    to save a picture as raw   you have to have the display on   this seems like a waste of battery power  lag","  it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter    trips      again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are      for those of you using a mac in os x  there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop  import","  one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful   mb compactflash card   and for most purposes   it is not enough    however   it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras  noise","  the included memory card is too small    go out and get a    meg card   it  s worth the expense  made","  it is made of plastic    for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped   picking up a camera like the g  is an unnerving experience    this is by no means unique to this model   i  m sure  lens","  the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot    this is not a handbag camera  size","","  the function lever   the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile  flash","  flash   as with all built in flashes in small cameras   you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost    the g  has a shoe which will take other powerful   and expensive   canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography  strap","  the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to    if you can afford this camera   you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere   a very minor quibble    good points  camera","","  to address two previous somewhat negative reviews         yes   the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder   however   the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder          there are   actually   several differences between the g  and g    such as differences in continuous shooting   the optical lens   the control layout   playback zoom   image processing   and so on  ","  this camera has a major design flaw  viewfinder","  when you look through the viewfinder   not the lcd   the bottom left corner of the picture   about        is blocked by the lens    i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera    after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder   they finally admitted   it was a design flaw in the camera  camera","  i  ve been bothered by blown out highlights on the s      and the g  seems to do only slightly better      i  m starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level    no off button","  the on off button feels somewhat flimsy   and has an awkward   tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera  body","  and the body   construction in general has quite a bit of plastic   a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s       i bought a     mb card   which seems to hold about     photos at the highest resolution  download","  the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking   it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap   and it is a bit slow between shots  camera"," camera"]}
