success with the above mentioned disks    i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit    the comments i  ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote for instance   pushing the button to play pal   european type   movies   when an ntsc   usa type

success with the above mentioned disks    i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit    the comments i  ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote for instance   pushing the button to play pal   european type   movies   when an ntsc   usa type

success with the above mentioned disks    i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit    the comments i  ve read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote for instance   pushing the button to play pal   european type   movies   when an ntsc   usa type   movie disk is in the disk tray    so   if you read the instructions well   you should n t have any problems with this dvd unit    i can  t speak to its long term reliability   as i  ve only had the
